1,AI in health and medicine,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to broadly reshape medicine, potentially improving the experiences of both clinicians and patients. We discuss key findings from a 2-year weekly effort to track and share key developments in medical AI. We cover prospective studies and advances in medical image analysis, which have reduced the gap between research and deployment. We also address several promising avenues for novel medical AI research, including non-image data sources, unconventional problem formulations and human–AI collaboration. Finally, we consider serious technical and ethical challenges in issues spanning from data scarcity to racial bias. As these challenges are addressed, AI’s potential may be realized, making healthcare more accurate, efficient and accessible for patients worldwide. AI has the potential to reshape medicine and make healthcare more accurate, efficient and accessible; this Review discusses recent progress, opportunities and challenges toward achieving this goal.","Pranav Rajpurkar and Emma Chen and Oishi Banerjee and Eric J.

2,Learning Deep Architectures for AI,"Theoretical results strongly suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one needs deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.",Yoshua Bengio,https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207178999,Artifical Intelligence,,,,theoret result strongli suggest order learn kind complic function repres highlevel abstract eg vision languag ailevel task one need deep architectur deep architectur compos multipl level nonlinear oper neural net mani hidden layer complic proposit formula reus mani subformula search paramet space deep architectur difficult optim task learn algorithm deep belief network recent propos tackl problem notabl success beat stateoftheart certain area paper discuss motiv principl regard learn algorithm deep architectur particular exploit build block unsupervis learn singlelay model restrict boltzmann machin use construct deeper model deep belief network,learn deep architectur ai,learn deep architectur ai theoret result strongli suggest order learn kind complic function repres highlevel abstract eg vision languag ailevel task one need deep architectur deep architectur compos multipl level nonlinear oper neural net mani hidden layer complic proposit formula reus mani subformula search paramet space deep architectur difficult optim task learn algorithm deep belief network recent propos tackl problem notabl success beat stateoftheart certain area paper discuss motiv principl regard learn algorithm deep architectur particular exploit build block unsupervis learn singlelay model restrict boltzmann machin use construct deeper model deep belief network
3,"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, Taxonomies, Opportunities and Challenges toward Responsible AI","In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed
appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this
to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability,
an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural
Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models).
Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely
acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in
this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a
prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define
explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that
covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability
is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions
related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining
Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This
critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI,
such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept
of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI
methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our
ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve
as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and
professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any
prior bias for its lack of interpretability","Alejandro Barredo Arrietaa, Natalia D´ıaz-Rodr´ıguezb",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10045,Artifical Intelligence,,,,last year artifici intellig ai achiev notabl momentum har appropri may deliv best expect mani applic sector across field occur shortli machin learn entir commun stand front barrier explain inher problem latest techniqu brought subsymbol eg ensembl deep neural network present last hype ai name expert system rule base model paradigm underli problem fall within socal explain ai xai field wide acknowledg crucial featur practic deploy ai model overview present articl examin exist literatur contribut alreadi done field xai includ prospect toward yet reach purpos summar previou effort made defin explain machin learn establish novel definit explain machin learn cover prior conceptu proposit major focu audienc explain sought depart definit propos discuss taxonomi recent contribut relat explain differ machin learn model includ aim explain deep learn method second dedic taxonomi built examin detail critic literatur analysi serv motiv background seri challeng face xai interest crossroad data fusion explain prospect lead toward concept respons artifici intellig name methodolog largescal implement ai method real organ fair model explain account core ultim goal provid newcom field xai thorough taxonomi serv refer materi order stimul futur research advanc also encourag expert profession disciplin embrac benefit ai activ sector without prior bia lack interpret,explain artifici intellig xai concept taxonomi opportun challeng toward respons ai,explain artifici intellig xai concept taxonomi opportun challeng toward respons ai last year artifici intellig ai achiev notabl momentum har appropri may deliv best expect mani applic sector across field occur shortli machin learn entir commun stand front barrier explain inher problem latest techniqu brought subsymbol eg ensembl deep neural network present last hype ai name expert system rule base model paradigm underli problem fall within socal explain ai xai field wide acknowledg crucial featur practic deploy ai model overview present articl examin exist literatur contribut alreadi done field xai includ prospect toward yet reach purpos summar previou effort made defin explain machin learn establish novel definit explain machin learn cover prior conceptu proposit major focu audienc explain sought depart definit propos discuss taxonomi recent contribut relat explain differ machin learn model includ aim explain deep learn method second dedic taxonomi built examin detail critic literatur analysi serv motiv background seri challeng face xai interest crossroad data fusion explain prospect lead toward concept respons artifici intellig name methodolog largescal implement ai method real organ fair model explain account core ultim goal provid newcom field xai thorough taxonomi serv refer materi order stimul futur research advanc also encourag expert profession disciplin embrac benefit ai activ sector without prior bia lack interpret
4,HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face,"Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. While there are numerous AI models available for various domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks autonomously. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional abilities in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks, with language serving as a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, an LLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT can tackle a wide range of sophisticated AI tasks spanning different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards the realization of artificial general intelligence.","Yongliang Shen, Y.

5,Can AI-Generated Text be Reliably Detected?,"The unregulated use of LLMs can potentially lead to malicious consequences such as plagiarism, generating fake news, spamming, etc. Therefore, reliable detection of AI-generated text can be critical to ensure the responsible use of LLMs. Recent works attempt to tackle this problem either using certain model signatures present in the generated text outputs or by applying watermarking techniques that imprint specific patterns onto them. In this paper, we show that these detectors are not reliable in practical scenarios. In particular, we develop a recursive paraphrasing attack to apply on AI text, which can break a whole range of detectors, including the ones using the watermarking schemes as well as neural network-based detectors, zero-shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors. Our experiments include passages around 300 tokens in length, showing the sensitivity of the detectors even in the case of relatively long passages. We also observe that our recursive paraphrasing only degrades text quality slightly, measured via human studies, and metrics such as perplexity scores and accuracy on text benchmarks. Additionally, we show that even LLMs protected by watermarking schemes can be vulnerable against spoofing attacks aimed to mislead detectors to classify human-written text as AI-generated, potentially causing reputational damages to the developers. In particular, we show that an adversary can infer hidden AI text signatures of the LLM outputs without having white-box access to the detection method. Finally, we provide a theoretical connection between the AUROC of the best possible detector and the Total Variation distance between human and AI text distributions that can be used to study the fundamental hardness of the reliable detection problem for advanced language models.

6,From local explanations to global understanding with explainable AI for trees,"Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees and gradient boosted trees are popular nonlinear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model’s performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains. Tree-based machine learning models are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance and public services. The authors present an explanation method for trees that enables the computation of optimal local explanations for individual predictions, and demonstrate their method on three medical datasets.","Scott M.

7,Education in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI): Understanding the Potential Benefits of ChatGPT in Promoting Teaching and Learning,"Since its maiden release into the public domain on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT garnered more than one million subscribers within a week. The generative AI tool ⎼ChatGPT took the world by surprise with it sophisticated capacity to carry out remarkably complex tasks. The extraordinary abilities of ChatGPT to perform complex tasks within the field of education has caused mixed feelings among educators, as this advancement in AI seems to revolutionize existing educational praxis. This is an exploratory study that synthesizes recent extant literature to offer some potential benefits and drawbacks of ChatGPT in promoting teaching and learning. Benefits of ChatGPT include but are not limited to promotion of personalized and interactive learning, generating prompts for formative assessment activities that provide ongoing feedback to inform teaching and learning etc. The paper also highlights some inherent limitations in the ChatGPT such as generating wrong information, biases in data training, which may augment existing biases, privacy issues etc. The study offers recommendations on how ChatGPT could be leveraged to maximize teaching and learning.

8,Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback,"As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.","Yuntao Bai, Saurav Kadavath",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Constitutional-AI%3A-Harmlessness-from-AI-Feedback-Bai-Kadavath/3936fd3c6187f606c6e4e2e20b196dbc41cc4654,Artifical Intelligence,,,,ai system becom capabl would like enlist help supervis ai experi method train harmless ai assist selfimprov without human label identifi harm output human oversight provid list rule principl refer method constitut ai process involv supervis learn reinforc learn phase supervis phase sampl initi model gener selfcritiqu revis finetun origin model revis respons rl phase sampl finetun model use model evalu two sampl better train prefer model dataset ai prefer train rl use prefer model reward signal ie use rl ai feedback rlaif result abl train harmless nonevas ai assist engag harm queri explain object sl rl method leverag chainofthought style reason improv humanjudg perform transpar ai decis make method make possibl control ai behavior precis far fewer human label,constitut ai harmless ai feedback,constitut ai harmless ai feedback ai system becom capabl would like enlist help supervis ai experi method train harmless ai assist selfimprov without human label identifi harm output human oversight provid list rule principl refer method constitut ai process involv supervis learn reinforc learn phase supervis phase sampl initi model gener selfcritiqu revis finetun origin model revis respons rl phase sampl finetun model use model evalu two sampl better train prefer model dataset ai prefer train rl use prefer model reward signal ie use rl ai feedback rlaif result abl train harmless nonevas ai assist engag harm queri explain object sl rl method leverag chainofthought style reason improv humanjudg perform transpar ai decis make method make possibl control ai behavior precis far fewer human label
9,Why Johnny Can’t Prompt: How Non-AI Experts Try (and Fail) to Design LLM Prompts,"Pre-trained large language models (“LLMs”) like GPT-3 can engage in fluent, multi-turn instruction-taking out-of-the-box, making them attractive materials for designing natural language interactions. Using natural language to steer LLM outputs (“prompting”) has emerged as an important design technique potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting effective prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based interactions are brittle. Here, we explore whether non-AI-experts can successfully engage in “end-user prompt engineering” using a design probe—a prototype LLM-based chatbot design tool supporting development and systematic evaluation of prompting strategies. Ultimately, our probe participants explored prompt designs opportunistically, not systematically, and struggled in ways echoing end-user programming systems and interactive machine learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were barriers to effective prompt design. These findings have implications for non-AI-expert-facing LLM-based tool design and for improving LLM-and-prompt literacy among programmers and the public, and present opportunities for further research.","J.D.

10,Engineering Education in the Era of ChatGPT: Promise and Pitfalls of Generative AI for Education,"Engineering education is constantly evolving to keep up with the latest technological developments and meet the changing needs of the engineering industry. One promising development in this field is the use of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT has the potential to offer personalized and effective learning experiences by providing students with customized feedback and explanations, as well as creating realistic virtual simulations for hands-on learning. However, it is important to also consider the limitations of this technology. ChatGPT and other generative AI systems are only as good as their training data and may perpetuate biases or even generate and spread misinformation. Additionally, the use of generative AI in education raises ethical concerns such as the potential for unethical or dishonest use by students and the potential unemployment of humans who are made redundant by technology. While the current state of generative AI technology represented by ChatGPT is impressive but flawed, it is only a preview of what is to come.

11,Large Language Models can be Guided to Evade AI-Generated Text Detection,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks and have been extensively utilized by the public. However, the increasing concerns regarding the misuse of LLMs, such as plagiarism and spamming, have led to the development of multiple detectors, including fine-tuned classifiers and statistical methods. In this study, we equip LLMs with prompts, rather than relying on an external paraphraser, to evaluate the vulnerability of these detectors. We propose a novel Substitution-based In-Context example Optimization method (SICO) to automatically construct prompts for evading the detectors. SICO is cost-efficient as it requires only 40 human-written examples and a limited number of LLM inferences to generate a prompt. Moreover, once a task-specific prompt has been constructed, it can be universally used against a wide range of detectors. Extensive experiments across three real-world tasks demonstrate that SICO significantly outperforms the paraphraser baselines and enables GPT-3.5 to successfully evade six detectors, decreasing their AUC by 0.5 on average.

12,MEGA: Multilingual Evaluation of Generative AI,"Generative AI models have shown impressive performance on many Natural Language Processing tasks such as language understanding, reasoning, and language generation. An important question being asked by the AI community today is about the capabilities and limits of these models, and it is clear that evaluating generative AI is very challenging. Most studies on generative LLMs have been restricted to English and it is unclear how capable these models are at understanding and generating text in other languages. We present the first comprehensive benchmarking of generative LLMs - MEGA, which evaluates models on standard NLP benchmarks, covering 16 NLP datasets across 70 typologically diverse languages. We compare the performance of generative LLMs including Chat-GPT and GPT-4 to State of the Art (SOTA) non-autoregressive models on these tasks to determine how well generative models perform compared to the previous generation of LLMs. We present a thorough analysis of the performance of models across languages and tasks and discuss challenges in improving the performance of generative LLMs on low-resource languages. We create a framework for evaluating generative LLMs in the multilingual setting and provide directions for future progress in the field.","Kabir Ahuja, Rishav Hada, Millicent Ochieng, Prachi Jain, Harshita Diddee, Krithika Ramesh, Samuel Maina, T.

13,On the Reliability of Watermarks for Large Language Models,"As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood the internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. Watermarking is a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the detection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a 1e-5 false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.","John Kirchenbauer, Jonas Geiping, Yuxin Wen, Manli Shu, Khalid Saifullah, Kezhi Kong, Kasun Fernando, Aniruddha Saha, Micah Goldblum, T.

14,A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT,"Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC.","Yihan Cao, Siyu Li, Yixin Liu, Zhiling Yan, Yutong Dai, Philip S.

16,Regulating ChatGPT and other Large Generative AI Models,"Large generative AI models (LGAIMs), such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 or Stable Diffusion, are rapidly transforming the way we communicate, illustrate, and create. However, AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, has primarily focused on conventional AI models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI regulation, and ask how the law can be tailored to their capabilities. After laying technical foundations, the legal part of the paper proceeds in four steps, covering (1) direct regulation, (2) data protection, (3) content moderation, and (4) policy proposals. It suggests a novel terminology to capture the AI value chain in LGAIM settings by differentiating between LGAIM developers, deployers, professional and non-professional users, as well as recipients of LGAIM output. We tailor regulatory duties to these different actors along the value chain and suggest strategies to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained models. The paper argues for three layers of obligations concerning LGAIMs (minimum standards for all LGAIMs; high-risk obligations for high-risk use cases; collaborations along the AI value chain). In general, regulation should focus on concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding transparency and (ii) risk management. Non-discrimination provisions (iii) may, however, apply to LGAIM developers. Lastly, (iv) the core of the DSA's content moderation rules should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This includes notice and action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers.","P. Hacker, A. Engel, M.

17,Generative AI,"Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have made it possible for machines to independently produce a variety of creative content. In the context of producing creative content, this essay examines the developments, difficulties, and ethical issues relating to generative AI. It looks into how generative models, such Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto encoders (VAEs), can produce realistic artwork like music, literature, and visuals. However, it is frequently discovered that GAN training is extremely unstable and frequently experiences non-convergence, mode collapse, and hyperparameter sensitivity [1]. The technical details of developing and optimizing generative models to produce desired results are covered in detail in this work. It also looks at the difficulties in guaranteeing the variety, creativity, and coherence of generated content. Additionally, the use of generative AI in the creation of original material raises ethical questions. Included in this are concerns about intellectual property, plagiarism, and possible effects on the creative industries. In specifically, the article explores the consequences of employing generative AI for content production in terms of authorship, human creativity, and the possible disruption of traditional creative practices. It also covers issues with fairness, bias, and appropriate application of generative models.","Stefan Feuerriegel, Jochen Hartmann, Christian Janiesch, Patrick Zschech",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:258240392,Artifical Intelligence,,,,recent advanc gener artifici intellig ai made possibl machin independ produc varieti creativ content context produc creativ content essay examin develop difficulti ethic issu relat gener ai look gener model gener adversari network gan variat auto encod vae produc realist artwork like music literatur visual howev frequent discov gan train extrem unstabl frequent experi nonconverg mode collaps hyperparamet sensit 1 technic detail develop optim gener model produc desir result cover detail work also look difficulti guarante varieti creativ coher gener content addit use gener ai creation origin materi rais ethic question includ concern intellectu properti plagiar possibl effect creativ industri specif articl explor consequ employ gener ai content product term authorship human creativ possibl disrupt tradit creativ practic also cover issu fair bia appropri applic gener model,gener ai,gener ai recent advanc gener artifici intellig ai made possibl machin independ produc varieti creativ content context produc creativ content essay examin develop difficulti ethic issu relat gener ai look gener model gener adversari network gan variat auto encod vae produc realist artwork like music literatur visual howev frequent discov gan train extrem unstabl frequent experi nonconverg mode collaps hyperparamet sensit 1 technic detail develop optim gener model produc desir result cover detail work also look difficulti guarante varieti creativ coher gener content addit use gener ai creation origin materi rais ethic question includ concern intellectu properti plagiar possibl effect creativ industri specif articl explor consequ employ gener ai content product term authorship human creativ possibl disrupt tradit creativ practic also cover issu fair bia appropri applic gener model

20,Art and the science of generative AI,"Understanding shifts in creative work will help guide AI’s impact on the media ecosystem The capabilities of a new class of tools, colloquially known as generative artificial intelligence (AI), is a topic of much debate. One prominent application thus far is the production of high-quality artistic media for visual arts, concept art, music, and literature, as well as video and animation. For example, diffusion models can synthesize high-quality images (1), and large language models (LLMs) can produce sensible-sounding and impressive prose and verse in a wide range of contexts (2). The generative capabilities of these tools are likely to fundamentally alter the creative processes by which creators formulate ideas and put them into production. As creativity is reimagined, so too may be many sectors of society. Understanding the impact of generative AI—and making policy decisions around it—requires new interdisciplinary scientific inquiry into culture, economics, law, algorithms, and the interaction of technology and creativity.","Ziv Epstein, Aaron Hertzmann, L.

23,Towards Generalist Biomedical AI,"Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.","Tao Tu, Shekoofeh Azizi, Danny Driess, M.

24,Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality,"The public release of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked tremendous interest in how humans will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to accomplish a variety of tasks. In our study conducted with Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm, we examine the performance implications of AI on realistic, complex, and knowledge-intensive tasks. The pre-registered experiment involved 758 consultants comprising about 7% of the individual contributor-level consultants at the company. After establishing a performance baseline on a similar task, subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: no AI access, GPT-4 AI access, or GPT-4 AI access with a prompt engineering overview. We suggest that the capabilities of AI create a “jagged technological frontier” where some tasks are easily done by AI, while others, though seemingly similar in difficulty level, are outside the current capability of AI. For each one of a set of 18 realistic consulting tasks within the frontier of AI capabilities, consultants using AI were significantly more productive (they completed 12.2% more tasks on average, and completed tasks 25.1% more quickly), and produced significantly higher quality results (more than 40% higher quality compared to a control group). Consultants across the skills distribution benefited significantly from having AI augmentation, with those below the average performance threshold increasing by 43% and those above increasing by 17% compared to their own scores. For a task selected to be outside the frontier, however, consultants using AI were 19 percentage points less likely to produce correct solutions compared to those without AI. Further, our analysis shows the emergence of two distinctive patterns of successful AI use by humans along a spectrum of humanAI integration. One set of consultants acted as “Centaurs,” like the mythical halfhorse/half-human creature, dividing and delegating their solution-creation activities to the AI or to themselves. Another set of consultants acted more like “Cyborgs,” completely integrating their task flow with the AI and continually interacting with the technology.","Fabrizio Dell'Acqua, Edward McFowland, Ethan R.

25,International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening,"Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful1. Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening. An artificial intelligence (AI) system performs as well as or better than radiologists at detecting breast cancer from mammograms, and using a combination of AI and human inputs could help to improve screening efficiency.","S.

26,Teachers’ AI digital competencies and twenty-first century skills in the post-pandemic world,"The pandemic has catalyzed a significant shift to online/blended teaching and learning where teachers apply emerging technologies to enhance their students’ learning outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has gained its popularity in online learning environments during the pandemic to assist students’ learning. However, many of these AI tools are new to teachers. They may not have rich technical knowledge to use AI educational applications to facilitate their teaching, not to mention developing students’ AI digital capabilities. As such, there is a growing need for teachers to equip themselves with adequate digital competencies so as to use and teach AI in their teaching environments. There are few existing frameworks informing teachers of necessary AI competencies. This study first explores the opportunities and challenges of employing AI systems and how they can enhance teaching, learning and assessment. Then, aligning with generic digital competency frameworks, the DigCompEdu framework and P21’s framework for twenty-first century learning were adapted and revised to accommodate AI technologies. Recommendations are proposed to support educators and researchers to promote AI education in their classrooms and academia.","D. Ng, J. Leung, Jiahong Su, R. Ng, S.

28,A systematic review of Green AI,"With the ever‐growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)‐based systems, the carbon footprint of AI is no longer negligible. AI researchers and practitioners are therefore urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models they design and use. This led in recent years to the appearance of researches tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI. Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this article, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm‐agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115%, with savings over 50% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.","Roberto Verdecchia, June Sallou, Luís Cruz",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:256274885,Artifical Intelligence,,,,ever‐grow adopt artifici intellig ai‐bas system carbon footprint ai longer neglig ai research practition therefor urg hold account carbon emiss ai model design use led recent year appear research tackl ai environment sustain field refer green ai despit rapid growth interest topic comprehens overview green ai research date still miss address gap articl present systemat review green ai literatur analysi 98 primari studi differ pattern emerg topic experienc consider growth 2020 onward studi consid monitor ai model footprint tune hyperparamet improv model sustain benchmark model mix posit paper observ studi solut paper present paper focu train phase algorithm‐agnost studi neural network use imag data laboratori experi common research strategi report green ai energi save go 115 save 50 rather common industri parti involv green ai studi albeit target academ reader green ai tool provis scarc conclus green ai research field result reach consider level matur therefor review emerg time suitabl adopt green ai research strategi port numer promis academ result industri practic,systemat review green ai,systemat review green ai ever‐grow adopt artifici intellig ai‐bas system carbon footprint ai longer neglig ai research practition therefor urg hold account carbon emiss ai model design use led recent year appear research tackl ai environment sustain field refer green ai despit rapid growth interest topic comprehens overview green ai research date still miss address gap articl present systemat review green ai literatur analysi 98 primari studi differ pattern emerg topic experienc consider growth 2020 onward studi consid monitor ai model footprint tune hyperparamet improv model sustain benchmark model mix posit paper observ studi solut paper present paper focu train phase algorithm‐agnost studi neural network use imag data laboratori experi common research strategi report green ai energi save go 115 save 50 rather common industri parti involv green ai studi albeit target academ reader green ai tool provis scarc conclus green ai research field result reach consider level matur therefor review emerg time suitabl adopt green ai research strategi port numer promis academ result industri practic
29,AI Art and its Impact on Artists,"The last 3 years have resulted in machine learning (ML)-based image generators with the ability to output consistently higher quality images based on natural language prompts as inputs. As a result, many popular commercial “generative AI Art” products have entered the market, making generative AI an estimated $48B industry [125]. However, many professional artists have spoken up about the harms they have experienced due to the proliferation of large scale image generators trained on image/text pairs from the Internet. In this paper, we review some of these harms which include reputational damage, economic loss, plagiarism and copyright infringement. To guard against these issues while reaping the potential benefits of image generators, we provide recommendations such as regulation that forces organizations to disclose their training data, and tools that help artists prevent using their content as training data without their consent.","Harry H.

30,Can AI Help in Screening Viral and COVID-19 Pneumonia?,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, which has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions of people worldwide. Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.","Vinu Sankar Sadasivan, Aounon Kumar, S.

31,"Democratising AI: Multiple Meanings, Goals, and Methods","Numerous parties are calling for “the democratisation of AI”, but the phrase is used to refer to a variety of goals, the pursuit of which sometimes conflict. This paper identifies four kinds of “AI democratisation” that are commonly discussed: (1) the democratisation of AI use, (2) the democratisation of AI development, (3) the democratisation of AI profits, and (4) the democratisation of AI governance. Numerous goals and methods of achieving each form of democratisation are discussed. The main takeaway from this paper is that AI democratisation is a multifarious and sometimes conflicting concept that should not be conflated with improving AI accessibility. If we want to move beyond ambiguous commitments to “democratising AI”, to productive discussions of concrete policies and trade-offs, then we need to recognise the principal role of the democratisation of AI governance in navigating tradeoffs and risks across decisions around use, development, and profits.","Elizabeth Seger, Aviv Ovadya, Divya Siddarth, Ben Garfinkel, A.

32,In Search of Verifiability: Explanations Rarely Enable Complementary Performance in AI-Advised Decision Making,"The current literature on AI‐advised decision making—involving explainable AI systems advising human decision makers—presents a series of inconclusive and confounding results. To synthesize these findings, we propose a simple theory that elucidates the frequent failure of AI explanations to engender appropriate reliance and complementary decision making performance. In contrast to other common desiderata, for example, interpretability or spelling out the AI's reasoning process, we argue that explanations are only useful to the extent that they allow a human decision maker to verify the correctness of the AI's prediction. Prior studies find in many decision making contexts that AI explanations do not facilitate such verification. Moreover, most tasks fundamentally do not allow easy verification, regardless of explanation method, limiting the potential benefit of any type of explanation. We also compare the objective of complementary performance with that of appropriate reliance, decomposing the latter into the notions of outcome‐graded and strategy‐graded reliance.","Raymond Fok, Daniel S.

33,Habitat: A Platform for Embodied AI Research,"We present Habitat, a platform for research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI). Habitat enables training embodied agents (virtual robots) in highly efficient photorealistic 3D simulation. Specifically, Habitat consists of: (i) Habitat-Sim: a flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling. Habitat-Sim is fast -- when rendering a scene from Matterport3D, it achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU. (ii) Habitat-API: a modular high-level library for end-to-end development of embodied AI algorithms -- defining tasks (e.g., navigation, instruction following, question answering), configuring, training, and benchmarking embodied agents. These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or 'merely' impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works and find evidence for the opposite conclusion -- that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations, and (2) we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test} x {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets.

35,"AI-Based Modeling: Techniques, Applications and Research Issues Towards Automation, Intelligent and Smart Systems","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a leading technology of the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0 or 4IR), with the capability of incorporating human behavior and intelligence into machines or systems. Thus, AI-based modeling is the key to build automated, intelligent, and smart systems according to today’s needs. To solve real-world issues, various types of AI such as analytical, functional, interactive, textual, and visual AI can be applied to enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. However, developing an effective AI model is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature and variation in real-world problems and data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on “AI-based Modeling” with the principles and capabilities of potential AI techniques that can play an important role in developing intelligent and smart systems in various real-world application areas including business, finance, healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, cybersecurity and many more. We also emphasize and highlight the research issues within the scope of our study.

36,"Advances, challenges and opportunities in creating data for trustworthy AI","As artificial intelligence (AI) transitions from research to deployment, creating the appropriate datasets and data pipelines to develop and evaluate AI models is increasingly the biggest challenge. Automated AI model builders that are publicly available can now achieve top performance in many applications. In contrast, the design and sculpting of the data used to develop AI often rely on bespoke manual work, and they critically affect the trustworthiness of the model. This Perspective discusses key considerations for each stage of the data-for-AI pipeline—starting from data design to data sculpting (for example, cleaning, valuation and annotation) and data evaluation—to make AI more reliable. We highlight technical advances that help to make the data-for-AI pipeline more scalable and rigorous. Furthermore, we discuss how recent data regulations and policies can impact AI. It has become rapidly clear in the past few years that the creation, use and maintenance of high-quality annotated datasets for robust and reliable AI applications requires careful attention. This Perspective discusses challenges, considerations and best practices for various stages in the data-to-AI pipeline, to encourage a more data-centric approach.","Weixin Liang, G.

37,Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Assisted Biomedical Systems for Intelligent Healthcare,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a modern approach based on computer science that develops programs and algorithms to make devices intelligent and efficient for performing tasks that usually require skilled human intelligence. AI involves various subsets, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), conventional neural networks, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition, with unique capabilities and functionalities that can improve the performances of modern medical sciences. Such intelligent systems simplify human intervention in clinical diagnosis, medical imaging, and decision-making ability. In the same era, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) emerges as a next-generation bio-analytical tool that combines network-linked biomedical devices with a software application for advancing human health. In this review, we discuss the importance of AI in improving the capabilities of IoMT and point-of-care (POC) devices used in advanced healthcare sectors such as cardiac measurement, cancer diagnosis, and diabetes management. The role of AI in supporting advanced robotic surgeries developed for advanced biomedical applications is also discussed in this article. The position and importance of AI in improving the functionality, detection accuracy, decision-making ability of IoMT devices, and evaluation of associated risks assessment is discussed carefully and critically in this review. This review also encompasses the technological and engineering challenges and prospects for AI-based cloud-integrated personalized IoMT devices for designing efficient POC biomedical systems suitable for next-generation intelligent healthcare.","Pandiaraj Manickam, Siva Ananth Mariappan, S.

38,"Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work”: Data Cascades in High-Stakes AI","AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and conservation. Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection, wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India, East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative, downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible, delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer and more robust systems for all.","Nithya Sambasivan, Shivani Kapania, H.

39,Explainable AI: A Review of Machine Learning Interpretability Methods,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread industrial adoption, with machine learning systems demonstrating superhuman performance in a significant number of tasks. However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into “black box” approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.","Pantelis Linardatos, Vasilis Papastefanopoulos, S.

40,Reporting guideline for the early stage clinical evaluation of decision support systems driven by artificial intelligence: DECIDE-AI,"A growing number of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems are showing promising performance in preclinical, in silico, evaluation, but few have yet demonstrated real benefit to patient care. Early stage clinical evaluation is important to assess an AI system’s actual clinical performance at small scale, ensure its safety, evaluate the human factors surrounding its use, and pave the way to further large scale trials. However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multistakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyse expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 predefined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation & Elaboration (E&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second, 16 in the consensus meeting, and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and 10 generic reporting items, with an E&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we have developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.","B. Vasey, M.

42,Opportunities and Adoption Challenges of AI in the Construction Industry: A PRISMA Review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with a range of capabilities, which are beginning to become apparent in all industries nowadays. The increased popularity of AI in the construction industry, however, is rather limited in comparison to other industry sectors. Moreover, despite AI being a hot topic in built environment research, there are limited review studies that investigate the reasons for the low-level AI adoption in the construction industry. This study aims to reduce this gap by identifying the adoption challenges of AI, along with the opportunities offered, for the construction industry. To achieve the aim, the study adopts a systematic literature review approach using the PRISMA protocol. In addition, the systematic review of the literature focuses on the planning, design, and construction stages of the construction project lifecycle. The results of the review reveal that (a) AI is particularly beneficial in the planning stage as the success of construction projects depends on accurate events, risks, and cost forecasting; (b) the major opportunity in adopting AI is to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks by using big data analytics and improving the work processes; and (c) the biggest challenge to incorporate AI on a construction site is the fragmented nature of the industry, which has resulted in issues of data acquisition and retention.

43,The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines,"In the past five years, private companies, research institutions and public sector organizations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). However, despite an apparent agreement that AI should be ‘ethical’, there is debate about both what constitutes ‘ethical AI’ and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies. As AI technology develops rapidly, it is widely recognized that ethical guidelines are required for safe and fair implementation in society. But is it possible to agree on what is ‘ethical AI’? A detailed analysis of 84 AI ethics reports around the world, from national and international organizations, companies and institutes, explores this question, finding a convergence around core principles but substantial divergence on practical implementation.","Anna Jobin, M.

44,A Survey on the Convergence of Edge Computing and AI for UAVs: Opportunities and Challenges,"The latest 5G mobile networks have enabled many exciting Internet of Things (IoT) applications that employ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/drones). The success of most UAV-based IoT applications is heavily dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, for instance, computer vision and path planning. These AI methods must process data and provide decisions while ensuring low latency and low energy consumption. However, the existing cloud-based AI paradigm finds it difficult to meet these strict UAV requirements. Edge AI, which runs AI on-device or on edge servers close to users, can be suitable for improving UAV-based IoT services. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of edge AI on key UAV technical aspects (i.e., autonomous navigation, formation control, power management, security and privacy, computer vision, and communication) and applications (i.e., delivery systems, civil infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, search and rescue (SAR) operations, acting as aerial wireless base stations (BSs), and drone light shows).

45,Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI,"Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community’s programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization’s impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI’s work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.","AI OrganizersOfQueerin, Anaelia Ovalle, Arjun Subramonian, Ashwin Singh, C.

46,What is AI Literacy? Competencies and Design Considerations,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated in user-facing technology, but public understanding of these technologies is often limited. There is a need for additional HCI research investigating a) what competencies users need in order to effectively interact with and critically evaluate AI and b) how to design learner-centered AI technologies that foster increased user understanding of AI. This paper takes a step towards realizing both of these goals by providing a concrete definition of AI literacy based on existing research. We synthesize a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies of AI literacy and suggest several design considerations to support AI developers and educators in creating learner-centered AI. These competencies and design considerations are organized in a conceptual framework thematically derived from the literature. This paper's contributions can be used to start a conversation about and guide future research on AI literacy within the HCI community.","D.

48,Intelligent Clinical Documentation: Harnessing Generative AI for Patient-Centric Clinical Note Generation,"Comprehensive clinical documentation is crucial for effective healthcare delivery, yet it poses a significant burden on healthcare professionals, leading to burnout, increased medical errors, and compromised patient safety. This paper explores the potential of generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to streamline the clinical documentation process, specifically focusing on generating SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and BIRP (Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan) notes. We present a case study demonstrating the application of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to transcribe patient-clinician interactions, coupled with advanced prompting techniques to generate draft clinical notes using large language models (LLMs). The study highlights the benefits of this approach, including time savings, improved documentation quality, and enhanced patient-centered care. Additionally, we discuss ethical considerations, such as maintaining patient confidentiality and addressing model biases, underscoring the need for responsible deployment of generative AI in healthcare settings. The findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize clinical documentation practices, alleviating administrative burdens and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care.","Anjanava Biswas, Wrick Talukdar",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:270067898,Artifical Intelligence,,,,comprehens clinic document crucial effect healthcar deliveri yet pose signific burden healthcar profession lead burnout increas medic error compromis patient safeti paper explor potenti gener ai artifici intellig streamlin clinic document process specif focus gener soap subject object assess plan birp behavior intervent respons plan note present case studi demonstr applic natur languag process nlp automat speech recognit asr technolog transcrib patientclinician interact coupl advanc prompt techniqu gener draft clinic note use larg languag model llm studi highlight benefit approach includ time save improv document qualiti enhanc patientcent care addit discuss ethic consider maintain patient confidenti address model bias underscor need respons deploy gener ai healthcar set find suggest gener ai potenti revolution clinic document practic allevi administr burden enabl healthcar profession focu direct patient care,intellig clinic document har gener ai patientcentr clinic note gener,intellig clinic document har gener ai patientcentr clinic note gener comprehens clinic document crucial effect healthcar deliveri yet pose signific burden healthcar profession lead burnout increas medic error compromis patient safeti paper explor potenti gener ai artifici intellig streamlin clinic document process specif focus gener soap subject object assess plan birp behavior intervent respons plan note present case studi demonstr applic natur languag process nlp automat speech recognit asr technolog transcrib patientclinician interact coupl advanc prompt techniqu gener draft clinic note use larg languag model llm studi highlight benefit approach includ time save improv document qualiti enhanc patientcent care addit discuss ethic consider maintain patient confidenti address model bias underscor need respons deploy gener ai healthcar set find suggest gener ai potenti revolution clinic document practic allevi administr burden enabl healthcar profession focu direct patient care
49,Trust in AI and Its Role in the Acceptance of AI Technologies,"Abstract As AI-enhanced technologies become common in a variety of domains, there is an increasing need to define and examine the trust that users have in such technologies. Given the progress in the development of AI, a correspondingly sophisticated understanding of trust in the technology is required. This paper addresses this need by explaining the role of trust in the intention to use AI technologies. Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis confirmed that trust had a significant effect the on intention to use AI, which operated through perceived usefulness and participants’ attitude toward voice assistants. In Study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S. population, different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory factor analysis, which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and functionality trust. The results of the path analyses from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, confirming the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use. Further, both dimensions of trust shared a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact on usage intention than human-like trust. Overall, the role of trust in the acceptance of AI technologies was significant across both studies.

50,"The Role of AI in Drug Discovery: Challenges, Opportunities, and Strategies","Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the drug discovery process, offering improved efficiency, accuracy, and speed. However, the successful application of AI is dependent on the availability of high-quality data, the addressing of ethical concerns, and the recognition of the limitations of AI-based approaches. In this article, the benefits, challenges, and drawbacks of AI in this field are reviewed, and possible strategies and approaches for overcoming the present obstacles are proposed. The use of data augmentation, explainable AI, and the integration of AI with traditional experimental methods, as well as the potential advantages of AI in pharmaceutical research, are also discussed. Overall, this review highlights the potential of AI in drug discovery and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for realizing its potential in this field. Note from the human authors: This article was created to test the ability of ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3.5 language model, in terms of assisting human authors in writing review articles. The text generated by the AI following our instructions (see Supporting Information) was used as a starting point, and its ability to automatically generate content was evaluated. After conducting a thorough review, the human authors practically rewrote the manuscript, striving to maintain a balance between the original proposal and the scientific criteria.

51,Effect of confidence and explanation on accuracy and trust calibration in AI-assisted decision making,"Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in high-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately calibrate human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.","Yunfeng Zhang, Q.

52,Learning design to support student-AI collaboration: perspectives of leading teachers for AI in education,"Preparing students to collaborate with AI remains a challenging goal. As AI technologies are new to K-12 schools, there is a lack of studies that inform how to design learning when AI is introduced as a collaborative learning agent to classrooms. The present study, therefore, aimed to explore teachers’ perspectives on what (1) curriculum design, (2) student-AI interaction, and (3) learning environments are required to design student-AI collaboration (SAC) in learning and (4) how SAC would evolve. Through in-depth interviews with 10 Korean leading teachers in AI in Education (AIED), the study found that teachers perceived capacity and subject-matter knowledge building as the optimal learning goals for SAC. SAC can be facilitated through interdisciplinary learning, authentic problem solving, and creative tasks in tandem with process-oriented assessment and collaboration performance assessment. While teachers expressed instruction on AI principles, data literacy, error analysis, AI ethics, and AI experiences in daily life were crucial support, AI needs to offer an instructional scaffolding and possess attributes as a learning mate to enhance student-AI interaction. In addition, teachers highlighted systematic AIED policy, flexible school system, the culture of collaborative learning, and a safe to fail environment are significant. Teachers further anticipated students would develop collaboration with AI through three stages: (1) learn about AI, (2) learn from AI, and (3) learn together. These findings can provide a more holistic understanding of the AIED and implications for the educational policies, educational AI design as well as instructional design that are aimed at enhancing SAC in learning.","Jae Hyun Kim, Hyunkyung Lee, Y.

53,Teachers' trust in AI-powered educational technology and a professional development program to improve it,"Evidence from various domains underlines the critical role that human factors, and especially trust, play in adopting technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI-specific misconceptions, myths and fears (e.g., mass unemployment and privacy violations). In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI-powered Educational Technology (AI-EdTech). This paper sheds light on teachers' trust in AI-EdTech and presents effective professional development strategies to increase teachers' trust and willingness to apply AI-EdTech in their classrooms. Our experiments with K-12 science teachers were conducted around their interactions with a specific AI-powered assessment tool (termed AI-Grader) using both synthetic and real data.

54,Human heuristics for AI-generated language are flawed,"Significance Human communication is now rife with language generated by AI. Every day, across the web, chat, email, and social media, AI systems produce billions of messages that could be perceived as created by humans. In this work, we analyze human judgments of self-presentations written by humans and generated by AI systems. We find that people cannot detect AI-generated self-presentations as their judgment is misguided by intuitive but flawed heuristics for AI-generated language. We demonstrate that AI systems can exploit these heuristics to produce text perceived as “more human than human.” Our results raise the question of how humanity will adapt to AI-generated text, illustrating the need to reorient the development of AI language systems to ensure that they support rather than undermine human cognition.","Maurice Jakesch, Jeffrey T.

55,Atlas of AI,"ATLAS OF AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence by Kate Crawford. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021. 336 pages. Hardcover; $28.00. ISBN: 9780300209570. *Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence is Kate Crawford's analysis of the state of the AI industry. A central idea of her book is the importance of redefining Artificial Intelligence (AI). She states, ""I've argued that there is much at stake in how we define AI, what its boundaries are, and who determines them: it shapes what can be seen and contested"" (p. 217). *My own definition of AI goes something like this: I¬†imagine a future where I'm sitting in a cafe drinking coffee with my friends, but in this future, one of my friends is a robot, who like me is trying to make a living in this world. A future where humans and robots live in harmony. Crawford views this definition as mythological: ""These mythologies are particularly strong in the field of artificial intelligence, where the belief that human intelligence can be formalized and reproduced by machines has been axiomatic since the mid-twentieth century"" (p.¬†5). I do not know if my definition of artificial intelligence can come true, but I am enjoying the process of building, experimenting, and dreaming. *In her book, she asks me to consider that I may be unknowingly participating, as she states, in ""a material product of colonialism, with its patterns of extraction, conflict, and environmental destruction"" (p. 38). The book's subtitle illuminates the purpose of the book: specifically, the power, politics, and planetary costs of usurping artificial intelligence. Of course, this is not exactly Crawford's subtitle, and this is where I both agree and disagree with her. The book's subtitle is actually Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence. In my opinion, AI is more the canary in the coal mine. We can use the canary to detect the poisonous gases, but we cannot blame the canary for the poisonous gas. It risks missing the point. Is AI itself to be feared? Should we no longer teach or learn AI? Or is this more about how we discern responsible use and direction for AI technology? *There is another author who speaks to similar issues. In Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O'Neil states it this way, ""If we had been clear-headed, we all would have taken a step back at this point to figure out how math had been misused ... But instead ... new mathematical techniques were hotter than ever ... A computer program could speed through thousands of resumes or loan applications in a second or two and sort them into neat lists, with the most promising candidates on top"" (p. 13). *Both Crawford and O'Neil point to human flaws that often lead to well-intentioned software developers creating code that results in unfair and discriminatory decisions. AI models encode unintended human biases that may not evaluate candidates as fairly as we would expect, yet there is a widespread notion that we can trust the algorithm. For example, the last time you registered an account on a website, did you click the checkbox confirming that ""yes, I read the disclaimer"" even though you did not? When we click ""yes"" we are accepting this disclaimer and placing trust in the software. Business owners place trust in software when they use it to make predictions. Engineers place trust in their algorithms when they write software without rigorous testing protocols. I¬†am just as guilty. *Crawford suggests that AI is often used in ways that are harmful. In the Atlas of AI we are given a tour of how technology is damaging our world: strip mining, labor injustice, the misuse of personal data, issues of state and power, to name a few of the concerns Crawford raises. The reality is that AI is built upon existing infrastructure. For example, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Amazon, TikTok have been collecting our information for profit even before AI became important to them. The data centers, CPU houses, and worldwide network infrastructure were already in place to meet consumer demand and geopolitics. But it is true that AI brings new technologies to the table, such as automated face recognition and decision tools to compare prospective employment applicants with diverse databases and employee monitoring tools that can make automatic recommendations. Governments, militaries, and intelligence agencies have taken notice. As invasion of privacy and social justice concerns emerge, Crawford calls us to consider these issues carefully. *Reading Crawford's words pricked my conscience, convicting me to reconsider my erroneous ways. For big tech to exist, to supply what we demand, it needs resources. She walks us through the many resources the technology industry needs to provide what we want, and AI is the ""new kid on the block."" This book is not about AI, per se; it is instead about the side effects of poor business/research practices, opportunist behavior, power politics, and how these behaviors not only exploit our planet but also unjustly affect marginalized people. The AI industry is simply a new example of this reality: data mining, low wages to lower costs, foreign workers with fewer rights, strip mining, relying on coal and oil for electricity (although some tech companies have made strides to improve sustainability). This sounds more like a parable about the sins of the tech industry than a critique about the dangers of AI. *Could the machine learning community, like the inventors of dynamite who wanted to simply help railroads excavate tunnels, be unintentionally causing harm? Should we, as a community, be on the lookout for these potential harms? Do we have a moral responsibility? Maybe the technology sector needs to look more inwardly to ensure that process efficiency and cost savings are not elevated as most important. *I did not agree with everything that Crawford classified as AI, but I do agree that as a community we are responsible for our actions. If there are injustices, then this should be important to us. In particular, as people of faith, we should heed the call of Micah 6:8 to act justly in this world, and this includes how we use AI. *Reviewed by Joseph Vybihal, Professor of Computer Science, McGill

56,Aligning AI With Shared Human Values,"We show how to assess a language model's knowledge of basic concepts of morality. We introduce the ETHICS dataset, a new benchmark that spans concepts in justice, well-being, duties, virtues, and commonsense morality. Models predict widespread moral judgments about diverse text scenarios. This requires connecting physical and social world knowledge to value judgements, a capability that may enable us to steer chatbot outputs or eventually regularize open-ended reinforcement learning agents. With the ETHICS dataset, we find that current language models have a promising but incomplete understanding of basic ethical knowledge. Our work shows that progress can be made on machine ethics today, and it provides a steppingstone toward AI that is aligned with human values.","Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andrew Critch, J.

57,Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?,"AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity. Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we release our user-study apparatus to researchers seeking to build on our work.","Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, D.

58,Artificial empathy in marketing interactions: Bridging the human-AI gap in affective and social customer experience,"Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform firm-customer interactions. However, current AI marketing agents are often perceived as cold and uncaring and can be poor substitutes for human-based interactions. Addressing this issue, this article argues that artificial empathy needs to become an important design consideration in the next generation of AI marketing applications. Drawing from research in diverse disciplines, we develop a systematic framework for integrating artificial empathy into AI-enabled marketing interactions. We elaborate on the key components of artificial empathy and how each component can be implemented in AI marketing agents. We further explicate and test how artificial empathy generates value for both customers and firms by bridging the AI-human gap in affective and social customer experience. Recognizing that artificial empathy may not always be desirable or relevant, we identify the requirements for artificial empathy to create value and deduce situations where it is unnecessary and, in some cases, harmful.","Y.

59,Integrating Ethics and Career Futures with Technical Learning to Promote AI Literacy for Middle School Students: An Exploratory Study,"The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) necessitates promoting AI education at the K-12 level. However, educating young learners to become AI literate citizens poses several challenges. The components of AI literacy are ill-defined and it is unclear to what extent middle school students can engage in learning about AI as a sociotechnical system with socio-political implications. In this paper we posit that students must learn three core domains of AI: technical concepts and processes, ethical and societal implications, and career futures in the AI era. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) workshop that aimed to integrate middle school students’ learning of the three domains. We found that after the workshop, most students developed a general understanding of AI concepts and processes (e.g., supervised learning and logic systems). More importantly, they were able to identify bias, describe ways to mitigate bias in machine learning, and start to consider how AI may impact their future lives and careers. At exit, nearly half of the students explained AI as not just a technical subject, but one that has personal, career, and societal implications. Overall, this finding suggests that the approach of incorporating ethics and career futures into AI education is age appropriate and effective for developing AI literacy among middle school students. This study contributes to the field of AI Education by presenting a model of integrating ethics into the teaching of AI that is appropriate for middle school students.","Helen Zhang, Irene A.

60,Thinking responsibly about responsible AI and ‘the dark side’ of AI,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been argued to offer a myriad of improvements in how we work and live. The notion of AI comprises a wide-ranging set of technologies that allow individuals and organizations to integrate and analyze data and use that insight to improve or automate decision-making. While most attention has been placed on the positive aspects companies realize by the adoption by the adoption and use of AI, there is a growing concern around the negative and unintended consequences of such technologies. In this special issue we have made a call for research papers that help us explore the dark side of AI use. By adopting a dark side lens, we aimed to expand our understanding of how AI should be implemented in practice, and how to minimize or avoid negative outcomes. In this editorial, we build on the notion of responsible AI, to highlight the different ways in which AI can potentially produce unintended consequences, as well as to suggest alternative paths future IS research can follow to improve our knowledge about how to mitigate such occurrences. We further expand on dark side theorizing in order to uncover hidden assumptions of current literature as well as to propose other prominent themes that can guide future IS research on AI adoption and use.","Patrick Mikalef, Kieran Conboy, J.

61,Are Explanations Helpful? A Comparative Study of the Effects of Explanations in AI-Assisted Decision-Making,"This paper contributes to the growing literature in empirical evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) methods by presenting a comparison on the effects of a set of established XAI methods in AI-assisted decision making. Specifically, based on our review of previous literature, we highlight three desirable properties that ideal AI explanations should satisfy—improve people’s understanding of the AI model, help people recognize the model uncertainty, and support people’s calibrated trust in the model. Through randomized controlled experiments, we evaluate whether four types of common model-agnostic explainable AI methods satisfy these properties on two types of decision making tasks where people perceive themselves as having different levels of domain expertise in (i.e., recidivism prediction and forest cover prediction). Our results show that the effects of AI explanations are largely different on decision making tasks where people have varying levels of domain expertise in, and many AI explanations do not satisfy any of the desirable properties for tasks that people have little domain expertise in. Further, for decision making tasks that people are more knowledgeable, feature contribution explanation is shown to satisfy more desiderata of AI explanations, while the explanation that is considered to resemble how human explain decisions (i.e., counterfactual explanation) does not seem to improve calibrated trust. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study for improving the design of XAI methods to better support human decision making.","Xinru Wang, Ming Yin",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID: 233224125,Artifical Intelligence,,,,paper contribut grow literatur empir evalu explain ai xai method present comparison effect set establish xai method aiassist decis make specif base review previou literatur highlight three desir properti ideal ai explan satisfy—improv peopl ’ understand ai model help peopl recogn model uncertainti support peopl ’ calibr trust model random control experi evalu whether four type common modelagnost explain ai method satisfi properti two type decis make task peopl perceiv differ level domain expertis ie recidiv predict forest cover predict result show effect ai explan larg differ decis make task peopl vari level domain expertis mani ai explan satisfi desir properti task peopl littl domain expertis decis make task peopl knowledg featur contribut explan shown satisfi desiderata ai explan explan consid resembl human explain decis ie counterfactu explan seem improv calibr trust conclud discuss implic studi improv design xai method better support human decis make,explan help compar studi effect explan aiassist decisionmak,explan help compar studi effect explan aiassist decisionmak paper contribut grow literatur empir evalu explain ai xai method present comparison effect set establish xai method aiassist decis make specif base review previou literatur highlight three desir properti ideal ai explan satisfy—improv peopl ’ understand ai model help peopl recogn model uncertainti support peopl ’ calibr trust model random control experi evalu whether four type common modelagnost explain ai method satisfi properti two type decis make task peopl perceiv differ level domain expertis ie recidiv predict forest cover predict result show effect ai explan larg differ decis make task peopl vari level domain expertis mani ai explan satisfi desir properti task peopl littl domain expertis decis make task peopl knowledg featur contribut explan shown satisfi desiderata ai explan explan consid resembl human explain decis ie counterfactu explan seem improv calibr trust conclud discuss implic studi improv design xai method better support human decis make
62,Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of human-AI interaction design principles.","Saleema Amershi, Daniel S.

63,Human–AI collaboration enables more empathic conversations in text-based peer-to-peer mental health support,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling systems that augment and collaborate with humans to perform simple, mechanistic tasks such as scheduling meetings and grammar-checking text. However, such human–AI collaboration poses challenges for more complex tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to the difficulties that AI systems face in navigating complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop HAILEY, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate HAILEY in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on TalkLife ( N  = 300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that our human–AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.6% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger, 38.9% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyse the human–AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social and high-stakes tasks such as empathic conversations. AI language modelling and generation approaches have developed fast in the last decade, opening promising new directions in human–AI collaboration. An AI-in-the loop conversational system called HAILEY is developed to empower peer supporters in providing empathic responses to mental health support seekers.","Ashish Sharma, Inna Wanyin Lin, Adam S.

65,The application of AI technologies in STEM education: a systematic review from 2011 to 2021,"Background The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in STEM education (AI-STEM), as an emerging field, is confronted with a challenge of integrating diverse AI techniques and complex educational elements to meet instructional and learning needs. To gain a comprehensive understanding of AI applications in STEM education, this study conducted a systematic review to examine 63 empirical AI-STEM research from 2011 to 2021, grounded upon a general system theory (GST) framework. Results The results examined the major elements in the AI-STEM system as well as the effects of AI in STEM education. Six categories of AI applications were summarized and the results further showed the distribution relationships of the AI categories with other elements (i.e., information, subject, medium, environment) in AI-STEM. Moreover, the review revealed the educational and technological effects of AI in STEM education. Conclusions The application of AI technology in STEM education is confronted with the challenge of integrating diverse AI techniques in the complex STEM educational system. Grounded upon a GST framework, this research reviewed the empirical AI-STEM studies from 2011 to 2021 and proposed educational, technological, and theoretical implications to apply AI techniques in STEM education. Overall, the potential of AI technology for enhancing STEM education is fertile ground to be further explored together with studies aimed at investigating the integration of technology and educational system.","Weiqi Xu, Ouyang Fan",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:252370184,Artifical Intelligence,,,,background applic artifici intellig ai stem educ aistem emerg field confront challeng integr divers ai techniqu complex educ element meet instruct learn need gain comprehens understand ai applic stem educ studi conduct systemat review examin 63 empir aistem research 2011 2021 ground upon gener system theori gst framework result result examin major element aistem system well effect ai stem educ six categori ai applic summar result show distribut relationship ai categori element ie inform subject medium environ aistem moreov review reveal educ technolog effect ai stem educ conclus applic ai technolog stem educ confront challeng integr divers ai techniqu complex stem educ system ground upon gst framework research review empir aistem studi 2011 2021 propos educ technolog theoret implic appli ai techniqu stem educ overal potenti ai technolog enhanc stem educ fertil ground explor togeth studi aim investig integr technolog educ system,applic ai technolog stem educ systemat review 2011 2021,applic ai technolog stem educ systemat review 2011 2021 background applic artifici intellig ai stem educ aistem emerg field confront challeng integr divers ai techniqu complex educ element meet instruct learn need gain comprehens understand ai applic stem educ studi conduct systemat review examin 63 empir aistem research 2011 2021 ground upon gener system theori gst framework result result examin major element aistem system well effect ai stem educ six categori ai applic summar result show distribut relationship ai categori element ie inform subject medium environ aistem moreov review reveal educ technolog effect ai stem educ conclus applic ai technolog stem educ confront challeng integr divers ai techniqu complex stem educ system ground upon gst framework research review empir aistem studi 2011 2021 propos educ technolog theoret implic appli ai techniqu stem educ overal potenti ai technolog enhanc stem educ fertil ground explor togeth studi aim investig integr technolog educ system
66,The Ethics of AI Ethics: An Evaluation of Guidelines,"Current advances in research, development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse on AI ethics. In consequence, a number of ethics guidelines have been released in recent years.

67,Expanding Explainability: Towards Social Transparency in AI systems,"As AI-powered systems increasingly mediate consequential decision-making, their explainability is critical for end-users to take informed and accountable actions. Explanations in human-human interactions are socially-situated. AI systems are often socio-organizationally embedded. However, Explainable AI (XAI) approaches have been predominantly algorithm-centered. We take a developmental step towards socially-situated XAI by introducing and exploring Social Transparency (ST), a sociotechnically informed perspective that incorporates the socio-organizational context into explaining AI-mediated decision-making. To explore ST conceptually, we conducted interviews with 29 AI users and practitioners grounded in a speculative design scenario. We suggested constitutive design elements of ST and developed a conceptual framework to unpack ST’s effect and implications at the technical, decision-making, and organizational level. The framework showcases how ST can potentially calibrate trust in AI, improve decision-making, facilitate organizational collective actions, and cultivate holistic explainability. Our work contributes to the discourse of Human-Centered XAI by expanding the design space of XAI.","Upol Ehsan, Q. Liao, Michael J. Muller, Mark O. Riedl, Justin D.

68,A Review of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education from 2010 to 2020,"This study provided a content analysis of studies aiming to disclose how artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to the education sector and explore the potential research trends and challenges of AI in education. A total of 100 papers including 63 empirical papers (74 studies) and 37 analytic papers were selected from the education and educational research category of Social Sciences Citation Index database from 2010 to 2020. The content analysis showed that the research questions could be classified into development layer (classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), application layer (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and integration layer (affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification). Moreover, four research trends, including Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as an assessment of AI in education, were suggested for further investigation. However, we also proposed the challenges in education may be caused by AI with regard to inappropriate use of AI techniques, changing roles of teachers and students, as well as social and ethical issues. The results provide insights into an overview of the AI used for education domain, which helps to strengthen the theoretical foundation of AI in education and provides a promising channel for educators and AI engineers to carry out further collaborative research.","Xuesong Zhai, Xiaoyan Chu, C.

We characterize the carbon footprint of AI computing by examining the model development cycle across industry-scale machine learning use cases and, at the same time, considering the life cycle of system hardware. Taking a step further, we capture the operational and manufacturing carbon footprint of AI computing and present an end-to-end analysis for what and how hardware-software design and at-scale optimization can help reduce the overall carbon footprint of AI. Based on the industry experience and lessons learned, we share the key challenges and chart out important development directions across the many dimensions of AI.

70,Sustainable AI: AI for sustainability and the sustainability of AI,"While there is a growing effort towards AI for Sustainability (e.g. towards the sustainable development goals) it is time to move beyond that and to address the sustainability of developing and using AI systems. In this paper I propose a definition of Sustainable AI; Sustainable AI is a movement to foster change in the entire lifecycle of AI products (i.e. idea generation, training, re-tuning, implementation, governance) towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. As such, Sustainable AI is focused on more than AI applications; rather, it addresses the whole sociotechnical system of AI. I have suggested here that Sustainable AI is not about how to sustain the development of AI per say but it is about how to develop AI that is compatible with sustaining environmental resources for current and future generations; economic models for societies; and societal values that are fundamental to a given society. I have articulated that the phrase Sustainable AI be understood as having two branches; AI for sustainability and sustainability of AI (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions and computing power). I propose that Sustainable AI take sustainable development at the core of its definition with three accompanying tensions between AI innovation and equitable resource distribution; inter and intra-generational justice; and, between environment, society, and economy. This paper is not meant to engage with each of the three pillars of sustainability (i.e. social, economic, environment), and as such the pillars of sustainable AI. Rather, this paper is meant to inspire the reader, the policy maker, the AI ethicist, the AI developer to connect with the environment—to remember that there are environmental costs to AI.

72,Protocol for development of a reporting guideline (TRIPOD-AI) and risk of bias tool (PROBAST-AI) for diagnostic and prognostic prediction model studies based on artificial intelligence,"Introduction The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) were both published to improve the reporting and critical appraisal of prediction model studies for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation.

73,How to cheat on your final paper: Assigning AI for student writing,"This paper shares results from a pedagogical experiment that assigns undergraduates to “cheat” on a final class essay by requiring their use of text-generating AI software. For this assignment, students harvested content from an installation of GPT-2, then wove that content into their final essay. At the end, students offered a “revealed” version of the essay as well as their own reflections on the experiment. In this assignment, students were specifically asked to confront the oncoming availability of AI as a writing tool. What are the ethics of using AI this way? What counts as plagiarism? What are the conditions, if any, we should place on AI assistance for student writing? And how might working with AI change the way we think about writing, authenticity, and creativity? While students (and sometimes GPT-2) offered thoughtful reflections on these initial questions, actually composing with GPT-2 opened their perspectives more broadly on the ethics and practice of writing with AI. In this paper, I share how students experienced those issues, connect their insights to broader conversations in the humanities about writing and communication, and explain their relevance for the ethical use and evaluation of language models.",Paul Fyfe,https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID: 247403200,Artifical Intelligence,,,,paper share result pedagog experi assign undergradu “ cheat ” final class essay requir use textgener ai softwar assign student harvest content instal gpt2 wove content final essay end student offer “ reveal ” version essay well reflect experi assign student specif ask confront oncom avail ai write tool ethic use ai way count plagiar condit place ai assist student write might work ai chang way think write authent creativ student sometim gpt2 offer thought reflect initi question actual compos gpt2 open perspect broadli ethic practic write ai paper share student experienc issu connect insight broader convers human write commun explain relev ethic use evalu languag model,cheat final paper assign ai student write,cheat final paper assign ai student write paper share result pedagog experi assign undergradu “ cheat ” final class essay requir use textgener ai softwar assign student harvest content instal gpt2 wove content final essay end student offer “ reveal ” version essay well reflect experi assign student specif ask confront oncom avail ai write tool ethic use ai way count plagiar condit place ai assist student write might work ai chang way think write authent creativ student sometim gpt2 offer thought reflect initi question actual compos gpt2 open perspect broadli ethic practic write ai paper share student experienc issu connect insight broader convers human write commun explain relev ethic use evalu languag model

75,Green AI,"The computations required for deep learning research have been doubling every few months, resulting in an estimated 300,000x increase from 2012 to 2018 [2]. These computations have a surprisingly large carbon footprint [38]. Ironically, deep learning was inspired by the human brain, which is remarkably energy efficient. Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research. This position paper advocates a practical solution by making efficiency an evaluation criterion for research alongside accuracy and related measures. In addition, we propose reporting the financial cost or""price tag""of developing, training, and running models to provide baselines for the investigation of increasingly efficient methods. Our goal is to make AI both greener and more inclusive---enabling any inspired undergraduate with a laptop to write high-quality research papers.

76,Ethics of AI in Education: Towards a Community-Wide Framework,"While Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research has at its core the desire to support student learning, experience from other AI domains suggest that such ethical intentions are not by themselves sufficient. There is also the need to consider explicitly issues such as fairness, accountability, transparency, bias, autonomy, agency, and inclusion. At a more general level, there is also a need to differentiate between doing ethical things and doing things ethically, to understand and to make pedagogical choices that are ethical, and to account for the ever-present possibility of unintended consequences. However, addressing these and related questions is far from trivial. As a first step towards addressing this critical gap, we invited 60 of the AIED community’s leading researchers to respond to a survey of questions about ethics and the application of AI in educational contexts. In this paper, we first introduce issues around the ethics of AI in education. Next, we summarise the contributions of the 17 respondents, and discuss the complex issues that they raised. Specific outcomes include the recognition that most AIED researchers are not trained to tackle the emerging ethical questions. A well-designed framework for engaging with ethics of AIED that combined a multidisciplinary approach and a set of robust guidelines seems vital in this context.","Wayne Holmes, K.

77,Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,"The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.","Bo Li, Peng Qi, Bo Liu, Shuai Di, Jingen Liu, Jiquan Pei, Jinfeng Yi, Bowen Zhou",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID: 238259667,Artifical Intelligence,,,,rapid develop artifici intellig ai technolog enabl deploy variou system base howev mani current ai system found vulner impercept attack bias underrepres group lack user privaci protect shortcom degrad user experi erod peopl ’ trust ai system review provid ai practition comprehens guid build trustworthi ai system first introduc theoret framework import aspect ai trustworthi includ robust gener explain transpar reproduc fair privaci preserv account unifi current avail fragment approach toward trustworthi ai organ systemat approach consid entir lifecycl ai system rang data acquisit model develop system develop deploy final continu monitor govern framework offer concret action item practition societ stakehold eg research engin regul improv ai trustworthi final identifi key opportun challeng futur develop trustworthi ai system identifi need paradigm shift toward comprehens trustworthi ai system,trustworthi ai principl practic,trustworthi ai principl practic rapid develop artifici intellig ai technolog enabl deploy variou system base howev mani current ai system found vulner impercept attack bias underrepres group lack user privaci protect shortcom degrad user experi erod peopl ’ trust ai system review provid ai practition comprehens guid build trustworthi ai system first introduc theoret framework import aspect ai trustworthi includ robust gener explain transpar reproduc fair privaci preserv account unifi current avail fragment approach toward trustworthi ai organ systemat approach consid entir lifecycl ai system rang data acquisit model develop system develop deploy final continu monitor govern framework offer concret action item practition societ stakehold eg research engin regul improv ai trustworthi final identifi key opportun challeng futur develop trustworthi ai system identifi need paradigm shift toward comprehens trustworthi ai system
78,Ray: A Distributed Framework for Emerging AI Applications,"The next generation of AI applications will continuously interact with the environment and learn from these interactions. These applications impose new and demanding systems requirements, both in terms of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we consider these requirements and present Ray---a distributed system to address them. Ray implements a dynamic task graph computation model that supports both the task-parallel and the actor programming models. To meet the performance requirements of AI applications, we propose an architecture that logically centralizes the system's control state using a sharded storage system and a novel bottom-up distributed scheduler. In our experiments, we demonstrate sub-millisecond remote task latencies and linear throughput scaling beyond 1.8 million tasks per second. We empirically validate that Ray speeds up challenging benchmarks and serves as both a natural and performant fit for an emerging class of reinforcement learning applications and algorithms.","Philipp Moritz, Robert Nishihara, Stephanie Wang, Alexey Tumanov, Richard Liaw, Eric Liang, William Paul, Michael I.

A core challenge for both physics and artificial intelligence (AI) is symbolic regression: finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown function. Although this problem is likely to be NP-hard in principle, functions of practical interest often exhibit symmetries, separability, compositionality, and other simplifying properties. In this spirit, we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques. We apply it to 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, and it discovers all of them, while previous publicly available software cracks only 71; for a more difficult physics-based test set, we improve the state-of-the-art success rate from 15 to 90%.","S.

80,HUMAN + MACHINE: REIMAGINING WORK IN THE AGE OF AI,"Technology advances are making tech more...human. This changes everything you thought you knew about innovation and strategy. In their groundbreaking book Human + Machine, Accenture technology leaders Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson showed how leading organizations use the power of humanmachine collaboration to transform their processes and their bottom lines. Now, as AI continues to rapidly impact both life and work, those companies and other pioneers across industries are tipping the balance even more strikingly toward the human with technology-led strategy that is reshaping the very nature of innovation. In Radically Human, Daugherty and Wilson show this profound shift, fast-forwarded by the pandemic, toward more human—and more humane—technology. Artificial intelligence is becoming less artificial and more intelligent. Instead of data-hungry approaches to AI, innovators are pursuing dataefficient approaches that enable machines to learn as humans do. Instead of replacing workers with machines, they are unleashing human expertise to create human-centered AI. In place of lumbering legacy IT systems, they are building cloud-first IT architectures able to continuously adapt to a world of billions of connected devices. And they are pursuing strategies that will take their place alongside classic winning business formulas like disruptive innovation. These against-the-grain approaches to the basic building blocks of business—Intelligence, Data, Experience, Architecture, and Strategy (IDEAS)—are transforming competition. Industrial giants and startups alike are drawing on this radically human IDEAS framework to create new business models, optimize postpandemic approaches to work and talent, rebuild trust with their stakeholders, and show the way toward a sustainable future. With compelling insights and fresh examples from a variety of industries, Radically Human will forever change the way you think about, practice, and win with innovation. Artificial intelligence threatens to disrupt the professions as it has manufacturing. Frank Pasquale argues that law and policy can avert this outcome and promote better ones: instead of replacing humans, technology can make our labor more valuable. Through regulation, we can ensure that AI promotes inclusive prosperity. Two statistics professors describe how intelligent machines are changing the world and use stories, rather than equations, to explain the mathematical language they use and provide a better grasp on concepts in data and probability. AI is radically transforming business. Are you ready? Look around you. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a futuristic notion. It's here right now--in software that senses what we need, supply chains that ""think"" in real time, and robots that respond to changes in their environment. Twenty-first-century pioneer companies are already using AI to innovate and grow fast. The bottom line is this: Businesses that understand how to harness AI can surge ahead.

81,Understanding and Creating Art with AI: Review and Outlook,"Technologies related to artificial intelligence (AI) have a strong impact on the changes of research and creative practices in visual arts. The growing number of research initiatives and creative applications that emerge in the intersection of AI and art motivates us to examine and discuss the creative and explorative potentials of AI technologies in the context of art. This article provides an integrated review of two facets of AI and art: (1) AI is used for art analysis and employed on digitized artwork collections, or (2) AI is used for creative purposes and generating novel artworks. In the context of AI-related research for art understanding, we present a comprehensive overview of artwork datasets and recent works that address a variety of tasks such as classification, object detection, similarity retrieval, multimodal representations, and computational aesthetics, among others. In relation to the role of AI in creating art, we address various practical and theoretical aspects of AI Art and consolidate related works that deal with those topics in detail. Finally, we provide a concise outlook on the future progression and potential impact of AI technologies on our understanding and creation of art.","E.

82,Do as AI say: susceptibility in deployment of clinical decision-aids,"Artificial intelligence (AI) models for decision support have been developed for clinical settings such as radiology, but little work evaluates the potential impact of such systems. In this study, physicians received chest X-rays and diagnostic advice, some of which was inaccurate, and were asked to evaluate advice quality and make diagnoses. All advice was generated by human experts, but some was labeled as coming from an AI system. As a group, radiologists rated advice as lower quality when it appeared to come from an AI system; physicians with less task-expertise did not. Diagnostic accuracy was significantly worse when participants received inaccurate advice, regardless of the purported source. This work raises important considerations for how advice, AI and non-AI, should be deployed in clinical environments.","S. Gaube, Harini Suresh, M. Raue, Alexander Merritt, S. Berkowitz, E.

83,Transparency and the Black Box Problem: Why We Do Not Trust AI,"With automation of routine decisions coupled with more intricate and complex information architecture operating this automation, concerns are increasing about the trustworthiness of these systems. These concerns are exacerbated by a class of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses deep learning (DL), an algorithmic system of deep neural networks, which on the whole remain opaque or hidden from human comprehension. This situation is commonly referred to as the black box problem in AI. Without understanding how AI reaches its conclusions, it is an open question to what extent we can trust these systems. The question of trust becomes more urgent as we delegate more and more decision-making to and increasingly rely on AI to safeguard significant human goods, such as security, healthcare, and safety. Models that “open the black box” by making the non-linear and complex decision process understandable by human observers are promising solutions to the black box problem in AI but are limited, at least in their current state, in their ability to make these processes less opaque to most observers. A philosophical analysis of trust will show why transparency is a necessary condition for trust and eventually for judging AI to be trustworthy. A more fruitful route for establishing trust in AI is to acknowledge that AI is situated within a socio-technical system that mediates trust, and by increasing the trustworthiness of these systems, we thereby increase trust in AI.",Warren J. von Eschenbach,https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:239697230,Artifical Intelligence,,,,autom routin decis coupl intric complex inform architectur oper autom concern increas trustworthi system concern exacerb class artifici intellig ai use deep learn dl algorithm system deep neural network whole remain opaqu hidden human comprehens situat commonli refer black box problem ai without understand ai reach conclus open question extent trust system question trust becom urgent deleg decisionmak increasingli reli ai safeguard signific human good secur healthcar safeti model “ open black box ” make nonlinear complex decis process understand human observ promis solut black box problem ai limit least current state abil make process less opaqu observ philosoph analysi trust show transpar necessari condit trust eventu judg ai trustworthi fruit rout establish trust ai acknowledg ai situat within sociotechn system mediat trust increas trustworthi system therebi increas trust ai,transpar black box problem trust ai,transpar black box problem trust ai autom routin decis coupl intric complex inform architectur oper autom concern increas trustworthi system concern exacerb class artifici intellig ai use deep learn dl algorithm system deep neural network whole remain opaqu hidden human comprehens situat commonli refer black box problem ai without understand ai reach conclus open question extent trust system question trust becom urgent deleg decisionmak increasingli reli ai safeguard signific human good secur healthcar safeti model “ open black box ” make nonlinear complex decis process understand human observ promis solut black box problem ai limit least current state abil make process less opaqu observ philosoph analysi trust show transpar necessari condit trust eventu judg ai trustworthi fruit rout establish trust ai acknowledg ai situat within sociotechn system mediat trust increas trustworthi system therebi increas trust ai
84,"AI-Driven Cybersecurity: An Overview, Security Intelligence Modeling and Research Directions ","Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (or Industry 4.0), which can be used for the protection of Internet-connected systems from cyber threats, attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. To intelligently solve today’s various cybersecurity issues, popular AI techniques involving machine learning and deep learning methods, the concept of natural language processing, knowledge representation and reasoning, as well as the concept of knowledge or rule-based expert systems modeling can be used. Based on these AI methods, in this paper, we present a comprehensive view on “AI-driven Cybersecurity” that can play an important role for intelligent cybersecurity services and management. The security intelligence modeling based on such AI methods can make the cybersecurity computing process automated and intelligent than the conventional security systems. We also highlight several research directions within the scope of our study, which can help researchers do future research in the area. Overall, this paper’s ultimate objective is to serve as a reference point and guidelines for cybersecurity researchers as well as industry professionals in the area, especially from an intelligent computing or AI-based technical point of view.","Iqbal H.

85,Defining organizational AI governance,"Artificial intelligence (AI) governance is required to reap the benefits and manage the risks brought by AI systems. This means that ethical principles, such as fairness, need to be translated into practicable AI governance processes. A concise AI governance definition would allow researchers and practitioners to identify the constituent parts of the complex problem of translating AI ethics into practice. However, there have been few efforts to define AI governance thus far. To bridge this gap, this paper defines AI governance at the organizational level. Moreover, we delineate how AI governance enters into a governance landscape with numerous governance areas, such as corporate governance, information technology (IT) governance, and data governance. Therefore, we position AI governance as part of an organization’s governance structure in relation to these existing governance areas. Our definition and positioning of organizational AI governance paves the way for crafting AI governance frameworks and offers a stepping stone on the pathway toward governed AI.","Matti Mäntymäki, Matti Minkkinen, Teemu Birkstedt, M.

86,Planning chemical syntheses with deep neural networks and symbolic AI,"To plan the syntheses of small organic molecules, chemists use retrosynthesis, a problem-solving technique in which target molecules are recursively transformed into increasingly simpler precursors. Computer-aided retrosynthesis would be a valuable tool but at present it is slow and provides results of unsatisfactory quality. Here we use Monte Carlo tree search and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) to discover retrosynthetic routes. We combined Monte Carlo tree search with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and a filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics. In a double-blind AB test, chemists on average considered our computer-generated routes to be equivalent to reported literature routes.","Marwin H. S. Segler, M. Preuss, M.

87,Principled Artificial Intelligence: Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights-Based Approaches to Principles for AI,"The rapid spread of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has precipitated a rise in ethical and human rights-based frameworks intended to guide the development and use of these technologies. Despite the proliferation of these ""AI principles,"" there has been little scholarly focus on understanding these efforts either individually or as contextualized within an expanding universe of principles with discernible trends. To that end, this white paper and its associated data visualization compare the contents of thirty-six prominent AI principles documents side-by-side. This effort uncovered a growing consensus around eight key thematic trends: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. Underlying this “normative core,” our analysis examined the forty-seven individual principles that make up the themes, detailing notable similarities and differences in interpretation found across the documents. In sharing these observations, it is our hope that policymakers, advocates, scholars, and others working to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of AI will be better positioned to build on existing efforts and to push the fractured, global conversation on the future of AI toward consensus.","Jessica Fjeld, Nele Achten, Hannah Hilligoss, Ádám Nagy, Madhulika Srikumar ",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214464355,Artifical Intelligence,,,,rapid spread artifici intellig ai system precipit rise ethic human rightsbas framework intend guid develop use technolog despit prolifer ai principl littl scholarli focu understand effort either individu contextu within expand univers principl discern trend end white paper associ data visual compar content thirtysix promin ai principl document sidebysid effort uncov grow consensu around eight key themat trend privaci account safeti secur transpar explain fair nondiscrimin human control technolog profession respons promot human valu underli “ norm core ” analysi examin fortyseven individu principl make theme detail notabl similar differ interpret found across document share observ hope policymak advoc scholar other work maxim benefit minim harm ai better posit build exist effort push fractur global convers futur ai toward consensu,principl artifici intellig map consensu ethic rightsbas approach principl ai,principl artifici intellig map consensu ethic rightsbas approach principl ai rapid spread artifici intellig ai system precipit rise ethic human rightsbas framework intend guid develop use technolog despit prolifer ai principl littl scholarli focu understand effort either individu contextu within expand univers principl discern trend end white paper associ data visual compar content thirtysix promin ai principl document sidebysid effort uncov grow consensu around eight key themat trend privaci account safeti secur transpar explain fair nondiscrimin human control technolog profession respons promot human valu underli “ norm core ” analysi examin fortyseven individu principl make theme detail notabl similar differ interpret found across document share observ hope policymak advoc scholar other work maxim benefit minim harm ai better posit build exist effort push fractur global convers futur ai toward consensu
88,AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by Chaining Large Language Model Prompts,"Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential on simple tasks, their breadth of scope, lack of transparency, and insufficient controllability can make them less effective when assisting humans on more complex tasks. In response, we introduce the concept of Chaining LLM steps together, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next, thus aggregating the gains per step. We first define a set of LLM primitive operations useful for Chain construction, then present an interactive system where users can modify these Chains, along with their intermediate results, in a modular way. In a 20-person user study, we found that Chaining not only improved the quality of task outcomes, but also significantly enhanced system transparency, controllability, and sense of collaboration. Additionally, we saw that users developed new ways of interacting with LLMs through Chains: they leveraged sub-tasks to calibrate model expectations, compared and contrasted alternative strategies by observing parallel downstream effects, and debugged unexpected model outputs by “unit-testing” sub-components of a Chain. In two case studies, we further explore how LLM Chains may be used in future applications.","Tongshuang Sherry Wu, Michael Terry, Carrie J.

89,Human-Centered AI,"We identify three specific areas of focus to advance human-centered AI:• Designers and systems must understand the context of use and sense changes over time: Successful AI Engineering depends on the team’s ability to identify and articulate the desired system outcome and understand human and contextual factors affecting the outcome. The system itself must be able to learn when shifts in context have occurred. What are the best ways to maintain clarity around operational intent and mechanisms for adapting and evolving systems based on dynamic contexts and user needs?• Development of tools, processes, and practices to scope and facilitate human-machine teaming: Implementation of AI systems entails high levels of interdependence between human and machine. Adoption of AI systems requires the primary users to interact with and understand systems, gaining appropriate levels of trust. Every AI system needs to be designed to recognize boundaries and unfamiliar scenarios, and to provide transparency regarding its limitations.• Methods, mechanisms, and mindsets to engage in critical oversight: AI systems learn through data and observations, rather than being explicitly programmed for a deterministic outcome. Critical and reflective oversight by organizations, teams, and individuals that create and use AI systems is needed to uphold ethical principles and proactively consider the risks of bias, misuse, abuse, and unintended consequences through design, development, and ongoing deployment.For each area, we identify ongoing work as well and challenges and opportunities in developing and deploying AI systems with confidence.","Hollen Barmer, R.

90,Principles alone cannot guarantee ethical AI,"AI Ethics is now a global topic of discussion in academic and policy circles. At least 63 public-private initiatives have produced statements describing high-level principles, values, and other tenets to guide the ethical development, deployment, and governance of AI. According to recent meta-analyses, AI Ethics has seemingly converged on a set of principles that closely resemble the four classic principles of medical ethics. Despite the initial credibility granted to a principled approach to AI Ethics by the connection to principles in medical ethics, there are reasons to be concerned about its future impact on AI development and governance. Significant differences exist between medicine and AI development that suggest a principled approach in the latter may not enjoy success comparable to the former. Compared to medicine, AI development lacks (1) common aims and fiduciary duties, (2) professional history and norms, (3) proven methods to translate principles into practice, and (4) robust legal and professional accountability mechanisms.

91,"Re-examining Whether, Why, and How Human-AI Interaction Is Uniquely Difficult to Design","Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.","Qian Yang, Aaron Steinfeld, C.

92,"Formalizing Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Prerequisites, Causes and Goals of Human Trust in AI","Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.","Alon Jacovi, Ana Marasović, Tim Miller, Yoav Goldberg ",https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:222379602,Artifical Intelligence,,,,trust central compon interact peopl ai incorrect level trust may caus misus abus disus technolog precis natur trust ai prerequisit goal cognit mechan trust promot assess whether satisfi given interact work aim answer question discuss model trust inspir ident interperson trust ie trust peopl defin sociologist model rest two key properti vulner user abil anticip impact ai model decis incorpor formal contractu trust trust user ai model trust implicit explicit contract hold formal trustworthi detach notion trustworthi sociolog concept warrant unwarr trust present possibl caus warrant trust intrins reason extrins behavior discuss design trustworthi ai evalu whether trust manifest whether warrant final elucid connect trust xai use formal,formal trust artifici intellig prerequisit caus goal human trust ai,formal trust artifici intellig prerequisit caus goal human trust ai trust central compon interact peopl ai incorrect level trust may caus misus abus disus technolog precis natur trust ai prerequisit goal cognit mechan trust promot assess whether satisfi given interact work aim answer question discuss model trust inspir ident interperson trust ie trust peopl defin sociologist model rest two key properti vulner user abil anticip impact ai model decis incorpor formal contractu trust trust user ai model trust implicit explicit contract hold formal trustworthi detach notion trustworthi sociolog concept warrant unwarr trust present possibl caus warrant trust intrins reason extrins behavior discuss design trustworthi ai evalu whether trust manifest whether warrant final elucid connect trust xai use formal
93,Guidelines for clinical trial protocols for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the SPIRIT-AI extension,"The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. The CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI extensions improve the transparency of clinical trial design and trial protocol reporting for artificial intelligence interventions.","S. Cruz Rivera, Xiaoxuan Liu, A.

Precision medicine methods identify phenotypes of patients with less‐common responses to treatment or unique healthcare needs. AI leverages sophisticated computation and inference to generate insights, enables the system to reason and learn, and empowers clinician decision making through augmented intelligence. Recent literature suggests that translational research exploring this convergence will help solve the most difficult challenges facing precision medicine, especially those in which nongenomic and genomic determinants, combined with information from patient symptoms, clinical history, and lifestyles, will facilitate personalized diagnosis and prognostication.","Kevin B.

95,"From What to How: An Initial Review of Publicly Available AI Ethics Tools, Methods and Research to Translate Principles into Practices","The debate about the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence dates from the 1960s (Samuel in Science, 132(3429):741–742, 1960. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.132.3429.741; Wiener in Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine, MIT Press, New York, 1961). However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles—the ‘what’ of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)—rather than on practices, the ‘how.’ Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community’s ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology, the initial findings, and provides a summary of future research needs.","J. Morley, L.

97,Pivotal trial of an autonomous AI-based diagnostic system for detection of diabetic retinopathy in primary care offices,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long promised to increase healthcare affordability, quality and accessibility but FDA, until recently, had never authorized an autonomous AI diagnostic system. This pivotal trial of an AI system to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) in people with diabetes enrolled 900 subjects, with no history of DR at primary care clinics, by comparing to Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center (FPRC) widefield stereoscopic photography and macular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), by FPRC certified photographers, and FPRC grading of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Severity Scale (ETDRS) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). More than mild DR (mtmDR) was defined as ETDRS level 35 or higher, and/or DME, in at least one eye. AI system operators underwent a standardized training protocol before study start. Median age was 59 years (range, 22–84 years); among participants, 47.5% of participants were male; 16.1% were Hispanic, 83.3% not Hispanic; 28.6% African American and 63.4% were not; 198 (23.8%) had mtmDR. The AI system exceeded all pre-specified superiority endpoints at sensitivity of 87.2% (95% CI, 81.8–91.2%) (>85%), specificity of 90.7% (95% CI, 88.3–92.7%) (>82.5%), and imageability rate of 96.1% (95% CI, 94.6–97.3%), demonstrating AI’s ability to bring specialty-level diagnostics to primary care settings. Based on these results, FDA authorized the system for use by health care providers to detect more than mild DR and diabetic macular edema, making it, the first FDA authorized autonomous AI diagnostic system in any field of medicine, with the potential to help prevent vision loss in thousands of people with diabetes annually.

98,AI for radiographic COVID-19 detection selects shortcuts over signal,"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and radiologists have recently reported AI systems that accurately detect COVID-19 in chest radiographs. However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious ‘shortcuts’. Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for the detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical-imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, because the undesired ‘shortcuts’ learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of machine-learning healthcare models. The urgency of the developing COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of novel diagnostic approaches, many of which use machine learning. DeGrave and colleagues use explainable AI techniques to analyse a selection of these approaches and find that the methods frequently learn to identify features unrelated to the actual disease.","A.

However, there is no systematic review of digital twinning, particularly focusing on the role of AI-ML and big data, to guide the academia and industry towards future developments. Therefore, this article emphasizes the role of big data and AI-ML in the creation of digital twins (DTs) or DT-based systems for various industrial applications, by highlighting the current state-of-the-art deployments. We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field. Also, we identified development-tools that can facilitate various levels of the digital twinning.

1,Mobile ad hoc network access authentication mechanism based on rotation election and two-factor aggregation,"With the continuous development and progress of computer network communication technology, mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) with strong indestructibility and no fixed infrastructure have become one of the new hot research areas in the academic community. However, due to the open wireless channel and unpredictable changes of network topology, mobile ad hoc networks are susceptible to security threats such as identity spoofing, identity tracing, and DoS attacks, and face security problems that cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary to design a trusted access authentication scheme to authenticate the identity of unknown nodes and ensure the security of connected nodes. In this paper, the Certificate Authority rotation election algorithm based on improved DPoS and access authentication mechanism based on dual identity factor aggregation are proposed, which improve the authentication efficiency and the anti-attack ability of the authentication system, and ensure the security and stability of the network. At the same time, the authentication information is uploaded to the blockchain to ensure the security and immutability of the data. The safety analysis and performance simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme has high safety and good performance.","Lanlan Rui, Liangchen Zhao, Zilong Guo, Zihan Wang, Xuesong Qiu, Shaoyong Guo",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624006583,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,continu develop progress comput network commun technolog mobil ad hoc network manet strong indestruct fix infrastructur becom one new hot research area academ commun howev due open wireless channel unpredict chang network topolog mobil ad hoc network suscept secur threat ident spoof ident trace do attack face secur problem ignor therefor necessari design trust access authent scheme authent ident unknown node ensur secur connect node paper certif author rotat elect algorithm base improv dpo access authent mechan base dual ident factor aggreg propos improv authent effici antiattack abil authent system ensur secur stabil network time authent inform upload blockchain ensur secur immut data safeti analysi perform simul experi show propos scheme high safeti good perform,mobil ad hoc network access authent mechan base rotat elect twofactor aggreg,mobil ad hoc network access authent mechan base rotat elect twofactor aggreg continu develop progress comput network commun technolog mobil ad hoc network manet strong indestruct fix infrastructur becom one new hot research area academ commun howev due open wireless channel unpredict chang network topolog mobil ad hoc network suscept secur threat ident spoof ident trace do attack face secur problem ignor therefor necessari design trust access authent scheme authent ident unknown node ensur secur connect node paper certif author rotat elect algorithm base improv dpo access authent mechan base dual ident factor aggreg propos improv authent effici antiattack abil authent system ensur secur stabil network time authent inform upload blockchain ensur secur immut data safeti analysi perform simul experi show propos scheme high safeti good perform
2,INCS: Intent-driven network-wide configuration synthesis based on deep reinforcement learning,"Configuring modern networks is a complex task due to the intricate low-level configuration languages and diverse routing protocols used across numerous interconnected devices. Network configuration synthesis has been proposed to solve these challenges. However, existing synthesizers encounter several limitations: (i) They cannot scale to large topologies with more than a few tens of routers. (ii) They only support specific routing protocols. (iii) They require prolonged synthesis times. (iv) They lack configuration optimization.
To address these limitations, this paper introduces INCS, an end-to-end network configuration synthesizer designed to generate configurations that comply with any hard and soft specifications. It comprises a fact base graph constructor using graph embedding techniques, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor employing a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based optimizer trained with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The graph constructor translates network topology, hard specifications, and configuration sketches into a fact base graph. The predictor then generates initial configurations, which are further optimized by the optimizer to meet predefined soft specifications.
We compare INCS with two benchmark synthesizers: NetComplete and a neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR)-based synthesizer. The evaluation shows that INCS has superior synthesis speed and specification consistency. It is 27.9x faster than the benchmarks. Even in the presence of unsatisfiable hard specifications, INCS maintains 100% specification consistency, whereas Netcomplete fails to synthesize, and the NAR-based synthesizer achieves only 90% consistency.","Yuqi Dai a, Hua Zhang a, Jingyu Wang b, Jianxin Liao b, Penghui Zhang a",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624004729,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,configur modern network complex task due intric lowlevel configur languag divers rout protocol use across numer interconnect devic network configur synthesi propos solv challeng howev exist synthes encount sever limit scale larg topolog ten router ii support specif rout protocol iii requir prolong synthesi time iv lack configur optim address limit paper introduc inc endtoend network configur synthes design gener configur compli hard soft specif compris fact base graph constructor use graph embed techniqu graph neural network gnnbase predictor employ graph attent network gat model deep reinforc learn drlbase optim train deep determinist polici gradient ddpg algorithm graph constructor translat network topolog hard specif configur sketch fact base graph predictor gener initi configur optim optim meet predefin soft specif compar inc two benchmark synthes netcomplet neural algorithm reason narbas synthes evalu show inc superior synthesi speed specif consist 279x faster benchmark even presenc unsatisfi hard specif inc maintain 100 specif consist wherea netcomplet fail synthes narbas synthes achiev 90 consist,inc intentdriven networkwid configur synthesi base deep reinforc learn,inc intentdriven networkwid configur synthesi base deep reinforc learn configur modern network complex task due intric lowlevel configur languag divers rout protocol use across numer interconnect devic network configur synthesi propos solv challeng howev exist synthes encount sever limit scale larg topolog ten router ii support specif rout protocol iii requir prolong synthesi time iv lack configur optim address limit paper introduc inc endtoend network configur synthes design gener configur compli hard soft specif compris fact base graph constructor use graph embed techniqu graph neural network gnnbase predictor employ graph attent network gat model deep reinforc learn drlbase optim train deep determinist polici gradient ddpg algorithm graph constructor translat network topolog hard specif configur sketch fact base graph predictor gener initi configur optim optim meet predefin soft specif compar inc two benchmark synthes netcomplet neural algorithm reason narbas synthes evalu show inc superior synthesi speed specif consist 279x faster benchmark even presenc unsatisfi hard specif inc maintain 100 specif consist wherea netcomplet fail synthes narbas synthes achiev 90 consist
3,Adaptive and low-cost resource synchronization based on data distribution service in high dynamic networks,"In disaster-stricken areas monitoring, management, search, and rescue operations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in disaster management and emergency communication due to their high mobility. To efficiently coordinate and plan UAVs and their carried sensor and base station resources, synchronization is essential to establish consistency, laying the foundation for high-level demands. In such scenarios, synchronization relies on request–response (RR) or publish–subscribe (PS) forms of information exchange. Existing research in the field typically focuses on higher-level applications and selects either RR or PS synchronization, thereby overlooking the potential advantages that could be gained from combining both methods to meet synchronization requirements. We propose a resource synchronization method based on the Data Distribution Service (DDS) and a linear time complexity subscription mechanism tailored to specific query demands, which considers the pros and cons of the above two information exchange forms and the bottom-layer network topology. Experimental results using open-source simulation tools demonstrate that the proposed method adapts to scene requirements and decreases bandwidth by at least 21.2% and packet rate by at least 3.7% compared to different baseline methods across three topologies, while satisfying delay and query success rate requirements. Furthermore, the method maintains robust performance in the face of dynamic changes in network topology, showcasing its robustness.","Yanbo Liu a,Peng Yu a b, Junye Zhang a, Zhe Xiao b, Wenjing Li a",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624005516,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,disasterstricken area monitor manag search rescu oper unman aerial vehicl uav play crucial role disast manag emerg commun due high mobil effici coordin plan uav carri sensor base station resourc synchron essenti establish consist lay foundat highlevel demand scenario synchron reli request–respons rr publish–subscrib ps form inform exchang exist research field typic focus higherlevel applic select either rr ps synchron therebi overlook potenti advantag could gain combin method meet synchron requir propos resourc synchron method base data distribut servic dd linear time complex subscript mechan tailor specif queri demand consid pro con two inform exchang form bottomlay network topolog experiment result use opensourc simul tool demonstr propos method adapt scene requir decreas bandwidth least 212 packet rate least 37 compar differ baselin method across three topolog satisfi delay queri success rate requir furthermor method maintain robust perform face dynam chang network topolog showcas robust,adapt lowcost resourc synchron base data distribut servic high dynam network,adapt lowcost resourc synchron base data distribut servic high dynam network disasterstricken area monitor manag search rescu oper unman aerial vehicl uav play crucial role disast manag emerg commun due high mobil effici coordin plan uav carri sensor base station resourc synchron essenti establish consist lay foundat highlevel demand scenario synchron reli request–respons rr publish–subscrib ps form inform exchang exist research field typic focus higherlevel applic select either rr ps synchron therebi overlook potenti advantag could gain combin method meet synchron requir propos resourc synchron method base data distribut servic dd linear time complex subscript mechan tailor specif queri demand consid pro con two inform exchang form bottomlay network topolog experiment result use opensourc simul tool demonstr propos method adapt scene requir decreas bandwidth least 212 packet rate least 37 compar differ baselin method across three topolog satisfi delay queri success rate requir furthermor method maintain robust perform face dynam chang network topolog showcas robust
4,A congestion-aware user–cell association scheme to assist with traffic offloading in a three-tier heterogeneous network,"In this work, we aim to expand the cell range in congestion areas. To achieve this goal, we integrate UAV network into macro–micro cellular network to enhance coverage. However, the gain of deploying heterogeneous nodes is limit if there are no CRE (cell range expanding)-based method to steer users towards low-power nodes. Therefore, in order to further improve system access capacity, we propose a congestion-aware UA (user–cell association) scheme to offload queued traffic of cellular network into UAV network. To verify the superiority of proposed scheme, we utilize the low-complexity SG (stochastic-geometry) methods. Then in simulation analysis phase, we obtain five primary results: . The SG-based methods have lower computation complexity, and the convergence of derived expressions are verified. . The SG-based methods do not need the exact users’ location but the users’ density, which have improved the operability and robustness in infrastructure construction of wireless network. The congestion-aware UA scheme can prompt network to adjust association tier flexibly, which is very suitable for traffic unevenly-distributed regions.

5,Reliable edge-to-core optical networks: An optimal algorithm for maximal path diversity,"With the emergence of IoT applications, 5G, and edge computing, network resource allocation has shifted toward the edge, bringing services closer to the end users. These applications often require communication with the core network for purposes that include cloud storage, compute offloading, 5G-and-Beyond transport communication between centralized unit (CU), distributed unit (DU) and core network, centralized network monitoring and management, etc. As the number of these services increases, efficient and reliable connectivity between the edge and core networks is of the essence. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a well-suited technology for transferring large amounts of data by simultaneously transmitting several wavelength-multiplexed data streams over each single fiber optics link. WDM is the technology of choice in mid-haul and long-haul transmission networks, including edge-to-core networks, to offer increased transport capacity.
Optical networks are prone to failures of components such as network fiber links, sites, and transmission ports. A single network element failure alone can cause significant traffic loss due to the disruption of many active data flows. Thus, fault-tolerant and reliable network designs remain a priority. The architecture called “dual-hub and dual-spoke” is often used in metro area networks (MANs). A dual-hub, or in general a multi-hub network, consists of a set of designated destination nodes (hubs) in which the data traffic from all other nodes (the peripherals) should be directed to the hubs. Multiple hubs offer redundant connectivity to and from the core or wide area network (WAN) through geographical diversity. The routing of the connections (also known as lightpaths) between the peripheral node and the hubs has to be carefully computed to maximize path diversity across the edge-to-core network. This means that whenever possible the established redundant lightpaths must not contain a common Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG).
An algorithm is proposed to compute the most reliable set of SRLG disjoint shortest paths from any peripheral to all hubs. The proposed algorithm can also be used to evaluate the overall edge-to-core network reliability quantified through a newly introduced figure of merit.","Ali Shakeri, Tianliang Zhang",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624001002,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,emerg iot applic 5g edg comput network resourc alloc shift toward edg bring servic closer end user applic often requir commun core network purpos includ cloud storag comput offload 5gandbeyond transport commun central unit cu distribut unit du core network central network monitor manag etc number servic increas effici reliabl connect edg core network essenc wavelength divis multiplex wdm wellsuit technolog transfer larg amount data simultan transmit sever wavelengthmultiplex data stream singl fiber optic link wdm technolog choic midhaul longhaul transmiss network includ edgetocor network offer increas transport capac optic network prone failur compon network fiber link site transmiss port singl network element failur alon caus signific traffic loss due disrupt mani activ data flow thu faulttoler reliabl network design remain prioriti architectur call “ dualhub dualspok ” often use metro area network man dualhub gener multihub network consist set design destin node hub data traffic node peripher direct hub multipl hub offer redund connect core wide area network wan geograph divers rout connect also known lightpath peripher node hub care comput maxim path divers across edgetocor network mean whenev possibl establish redund lightpath must contain common share risk link group srlg algorithm propos comput reliabl set srlg disjoint shortest path peripher hub propos algorithm also use evalu overal edgetocor network reliabl quantifi newli introduc figur merit,reliabl edgetocor optic network optim algorithm maxim path divers,reliabl edgetocor optic network optim algorithm maxim path divers emerg iot applic 5g edg comput network resourc alloc shift toward edg bring servic closer end user applic often requir commun core network purpos includ cloud storag comput offload 5gandbeyond transport commun central unit cu distribut unit du core network central network monitor manag etc number servic increas effici reliabl connect edg core network essenc wavelength divis multiplex wdm wellsuit technolog transfer larg amount data simultan transmit sever wavelengthmultiplex data stream singl fiber optic link wdm technolog choic midhaul longhaul transmiss network includ edgetocor network offer increas transport capac optic network prone failur compon network fiber link site transmiss port singl network element failur alon caus signific traffic loss due disrupt mani activ data flow thu faulttoler reliabl network design remain prioriti architectur call “ dualhub dualspok ” often use metro area network man dualhub gener multihub network consist set design destin node hub data traffic node peripher direct hub multipl hub offer redund connect core wide area network wan geograph divers rout connect also known lightpath peripher node hub care comput maxim path divers across edgetocor network mean whenev possibl establish redund lightpath must contain common share risk link group srlg algorithm propos comput reliabl set srlg disjoint shortest path peripher hub propos algorithm also use evalu overal edgetocor network reliabl quantifi newli introduc figur merit
6,Secure and Efficient Authentication using Linkage for permissionless Bitcoin network,"The cryptocurrency’s permissionless and large-scale broadcasting requirements prohibit the traditional authentication implementation on the blockchain’s underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. Thus, blockchain networking implementations remain vulnerable to networking integrity threats such as spoofing or hijacking. We design Secure and Efficient Authentication using Linkage (SEAL) to build connection security for permissionless Bitcoin networking. SEAL uses the linkage between the packets for a symmetric operation, in contrast to the traditional authentication approach relying on identity-credential-based trust. To make it appropriate for cryptocurrency networking, SEAL utilizes the packet header, protects the end-to-end connection, and separates the online process and the offline process so that the real-time overhead is minimal for greater efficiency and practicality. We implement SEAL on a functioning Bitcoin node and demonstrate that SEAL operates efficiently with minimal overhead. Specifically, it reduces the hash rate by only 1.3% compared to an unsecured node. Additionally, we use a network simulator to emulate the Bitcoin Mainnet and analyze SEAL’s impact on block propagation delay. SEAL yields 2.04 times smaller delay and 1.25 times smaller delay in block propagation than HMAC and ChaCha20-Poly1305, respectively. The key advantage of SEAL is that it requires fewer hash computations and simpler mixing operations, resulting in significantly lower computational overhead compared to traditional authentication schemes based on message authentication codes (MACs).","Hsiang-Jen Hong , Sang-Yoon Chang , Wenjun Fan , Simeon Wuthier , Xiaobo Zhou ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624006728,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,cryptocurr ’ permissionless largescal broadcast requir prohibit tradit authent implement blockchain ’ underli peertop p2p network thu blockchain network implement remain vulner network integr threat spoof hijack design secur effici authent use linkag seal build connect secur permissionless bitcoin network seal use linkag packet symmetr oper contrast tradit authent approach reli identitycredentialbas trust make appropri cryptocurr network seal util packet header protect endtoend connect separ onlin process offlin process realtim overhead minim greater effici practic implement seal function bitcoin node demonstr seal oper effici minim overhead specif reduc hash rate 13 compar unsecur node addit use network simul emul bitcoin mainnet analyz seal ’ impact block propag delay seal yield 204 time smaller delay 125 time smaller delay block propag hmac chacha20poly1305 respect key advantag seal requir fewer hash comput simpler mix oper result significantli lower comput overhead compar tradit authent scheme base messag authent code mac,secur effici authent use linkag permissionless bitcoin network,secur effici authent use linkag permissionless bitcoin network cryptocurr ’ permissionless largescal broadcast requir prohibit tradit authent implement blockchain ’ underli peertop p2p network thu blockchain network implement remain vulner network integr threat spoof hijack design secur effici authent use linkag seal build connect secur permissionless bitcoin network seal use linkag packet symmetr oper contrast tradit authent approach reli identitycredentialbas trust make appropri cryptocurr network seal util packet header protect endtoend connect separ onlin process offlin process realtim overhead minim greater effici practic implement seal function bitcoin node demonstr seal oper effici minim overhead specif reduc hash rate 13 compar unsecur node addit use network simul emul bitcoin mainnet analyz seal ’ impact block propag delay seal yield 204 time smaller delay 125 time smaller delay block propag hmac chacha20poly1305 respect key advantag seal requir fewer hash comput simpler mix oper result significantli lower comput overhead compar tradit authent scheme base messag authent code mac
7,A two-step linear programming approach for repeater placement in large-scale quantum networks,"Thanks to the applications such as Quantum Key Distribution and Distributed Quantum Computing, the deployment of quantum networks is gaining great momentum. A major component in quantum networks is repeaters, which are essential for reducing the error rate of qubit transmission for long-distance links. However, repeaters are expensive devices, so minimizing the number of repeaters placed in a quantum network while satisfying performance requirements becomes an important problem. Existing solutions typically solve this problem optimally by formulating an Integer Linear Program (ILP). However, the number of variables in their ILPs is , where is the number of nodes in a network. This incurs infeasible running time when the network scale is large. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes to solve the repeater placement problem by two steps, with each step using a linear program of a much smaller scale with  variables. Although this solution is not optimal, it dramatically reduces the time complexity, making it practical for large-scale networks. Moreover, it constructs networks that have higher node connectivity than those by existing solutions, since it deploys slightly more number of repeaters into networks. Our extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world network topologies verified our claims.","Romtham Sripotchanart , Weisheng Si , Rodrigo N.

8,Designing the Network Intelligence Stratum for 6G networks,"As network complexity escalates, there is an increasing need for more sophisticated methods to manage and operate these networks, focusing on enhancing efficiency, reliability, and security. A wide range of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) models are being developed in response. These models are pivotal in automating decision-making, conducting predictive analyses, managing networks proactively, enhancing security, and optimizing network performance. They are foundational in shaping the future of networks, collectively forming what is known as Network Intelligence (NI). Prominent Standard-Defining Organizations (SDOs) are integrating NI into future network architectures, particularly emphasizing the closed-loop approach. However, existing methods for seamlessly integrating NI into network architectures are not yet fully effective. This paper introduces an in-depth architectural design for a Network Intelligence Stratum (NI Stratum). This stratum is supported by a novel end-to-end NI orchestrator that supports closed-loop NI operations across various network domains. The primary goal of this design is to streamline the deployment and coordination of NI throughout the entire network infrastructure, tackling issues related to scalability, conflict resolution, and effective data management. We detail exhaustive workflows for managing the NI lifecycle and demonstrate a reference implementation of the NI Stratum, focusing on its compatibility and integration with current network systems and open-source platforms such as Kubernetes and Kubeflow, as well as on its validation on real-world environments. The paper also outlines major challenges and open issues in deploying and managing NI.","Paola Soto , Miguel Camelo , Ginés García-Avilés",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624006121,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,network complex escal increas need sophist method manag oper network focus enhanc effici reliabl secur wide rang artifici intellig aimachin learn ml model develop respons model pivot autom decisionmak conduct predict analys manag network proactiv enhanc secur optim network perform foundat shape futur network collect form known network intellig ni promin standarddefin organ sdo integr ni futur network architectur particularli emphas closedloop approach howev exist method seamlessli integr ni network architectur yet fulli effect paper introduc indepth architectur design network intellig stratum ni stratum stratum support novel endtoend ni orchestr support closedloop ni oper across variou network domain primari goal design streamlin deploy coordin ni throughout entir network infrastructur tackl issu relat scalabl conflict resolut effect data manag detail exhaust workflow manag ni lifecycl demonstr refer implement ni stratum focus compat integr current network system opensourc platform kubernet kubeflow well valid realworld environ paper also outlin major challeng open issu deploy manag ni,design network intellig stratum 6g network,design network intellig stratum 6g network network complex escal increas need sophist method manag oper network focus enhanc effici reliabl secur wide rang artifici intellig aimachin learn ml model develop respons model pivot autom decisionmak conduct predict analys manag network proactiv enhanc secur optim network perform foundat shape futur network collect form known network intellig ni promin standarddefin organ sdo integr ni futur network architectur particularli emphas closedloop approach howev exist method seamlessli integr ni network architectur yet fulli effect paper introduc indepth architectur design network intellig stratum ni stratum stratum support novel endtoend ni orchestr support closedloop ni oper across variou network domain primari goal design streamlin deploy coordin ni throughout entir network infrastructur tackl issu relat scalabl conflict resolut effect data manag detail exhaust workflow manag ni lifecycl demonstr refer implement ni stratum focus compat integr current network system opensourc platform kubernet kubeflow well valid realworld environ paper also outlin major challeng open issu deploy manag ni
9,Network traffic prediction based on PSO-LightGBM-TM,"Network traffic prediction is critical in wireless network management by allowing a good estimate of the traffic trend, which is also an important approach for detecting traffic anomalies in order to enhance network security. Deep-learning-based method has been widely adopted to predict network traffic matrix (TM) though with the main drawbacks in high complexity and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a traffic prediction model based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and LightGBM (PSO-LightGBM-TM), which optimizes the LightGBM parameters for each network flow by PSO so that LightGBM can adapt to each of the network traffic flow. Compared with existing commonly used deep learning models, our model has a more straightforward structure and yet outperforms existing deep learning models. Sufficient comparison tests on three real network traffic datasets, Abilene, GÉANT, and CERNET have been conducted, and the results show that our model provides more accurate results and higher prediction efficiency.","Feng Li , Wei Nie , Kwok-Yan Lam , Li Wang",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138912862400642X,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,network traffic predict critic wireless network manag allow good estim traffic trend also import approach detect traffic anomali order enhanc network secur deeplearningbas method wide adopt predict network traffic matrix tm though main drawback high complex low effici paper propos traffic predict model base particl swarm optim pso lightgbm psolightgbmtm optim lightgbm paramet network flow pso lightgbm adapt network traffic flow compar exist commonli use deep learn model model straightforward structur yet outperform exist deep learn model suffici comparison test three real network traffic dataset abilen géant cernet conduct result show model provid accur result higher predict effici,network traffic predict base psolightgbmtm,network traffic predict base psolightgbmtm network traffic predict critic wireless network manag allow good estim traffic trend also import approach detect traffic anomali order enhanc network secur deeplearningbas method wide adopt predict network traffic matrix tm though main drawback high complex low effici paper propos traffic predict model base particl swarm optim pso lightgbm psolightgbmtm optim lightgbm paramet network flow pso lightgbm adapt network traffic flow compar exist commonli use deep learn model model straightforward structur yet outperform exist deep learn model suffici comparison test three real network traffic dataset abilen géant cernet conduct result show model provid accur result higher predict effici
10,Towards universal and transferable adversarial attacks against network traffic classification,"In recent years, deep learning technology has shown astonishing potential in many fields, but at the same time, it also hides serious vulnerabilities. In the field of network traffic classification, attackers exploit this vulnerability to add designed perturbations to normal traffic, causing incorrect network traffic classification to implement adversarial attacks. The existing network traffic adversarial attack methods mainly target specific models or sample application scenarios, which have many problems such as poor transferability, high time cost, and low practicality. Therefore, this article proposes a method towards universal and transferable adversarial attacks against network traffic classification, which can not only perform universal adversarial attacks on all samples in the network traffic dataset, but also achieve cross data and cross model transferable adversarial attacks, that is, it has transferable attack effects at both the network traffic data and classification model levels. This method utilizes the geometric characteristics of the network model to design the target loss function and optimize the generation of universal perturbations, resulting in biased learning of features at each layer of the network model, leading to incorrect classification results. Meanwhile, this article conducted universality and transferability adversarial attack verification experiments on standard network traffic datasets of three different classification applications, USTC-TFC2016, ISCX2016, and CICIoT2023, as well as five common network models such as LeNet5. The results show that the proposed method performs universal adversarial attacks on five network models on three datasets, USTC-TFC2016, ISCX2016, and CICIoT2023, with an average attack success rate of over 80 %, 85 %, and 88 %, respectively, and an average time cost of about 0–0.3 ms; And the method proposed in this article has shown good transferable attack performance between five network models and on three network traffic datasets, with transferable attack rates approaching 100 % across different models and datasets, which is more closely related to practical applications.","Ruiyang Ding , Lei Sun , Weifei Zang , Leyu Dai , Zhiyi Ding , Bayi Xu ",,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,recent year deep learn technolog shown astonish potenti mani field time also hide seriou vulner field network traffic classif attack exploit vulner add design perturb normal traffic caus incorrect network traffic classif implement adversari attack exist network traffic adversari attack method mainli target specif model sampl applic scenario mani problem poor transfer high time cost low practic therefor articl propos method toward univers transfer adversari attack network traffic classif perform univers adversari attack sampl network traffic dataset also achiev cross data cross model transfer adversari attack transfer attack effect network traffic data classif model level method util geometr characterist network model design target loss function optim gener univers perturb result bias learn featur layer network model lead incorrect classif result meanwhil articl conduct univers transfer adversari attack verif experi standard network traffic dataset three differ classif applic ustctfc2016 iscx2016 ciciot2023 well five common network model lenet5 result show propos method perform univers adversari attack five network model three dataset ustctfc2016 iscx2016 ciciot2023 averag attack success rate 80 85 88 respect averag time cost 0–03 ms method propos articl shown good transfer attack perform five network model three network traffic dataset transfer attack rate approach 100 across differ model dataset close relat practic applic,toward univers transfer adversari attack network traffic classif,toward univers transfer adversari attack network traffic classif recent year deep learn technolog shown astonish potenti mani field time also hide seriou vulner field network traffic classif attack exploit vulner add design perturb normal traffic caus incorrect network traffic classif implement adversari attack exist network traffic adversari attack method mainli target specif model sampl applic scenario mani problem poor transfer high time cost low practic therefor articl propos method toward univers transfer adversari attack network traffic classif perform univers adversari attack sampl network traffic dataset also achiev cross data cross model transfer adversari attack transfer attack effect network traffic data classif model level method util geometr characterist network model design target loss function optim gener univers perturb result bias learn featur layer network model lead incorrect classif result meanwhil articl conduct univers transfer adversari attack verif experi standard network traffic dataset three differ classif applic ustctfc2016 iscx2016 ciciot2023 well five common network model lenet5 result show propos method perform univers adversari attack five network model three dataset ustctfc2016 iscx2016 ciciot2023 averag attack success rate 80 85 88 respect averag time cost 0–03 ms method propos articl shown good transfer attack perform five network model three network traffic dataset transfer attack rate approach 100 across differ model dataset close relat practic applic
11,A fault tolerant node placement algorithm for WSNs and IoT networks,"The operation of Internet of Things (IoT) Network and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be often disrupted by a number of factors, such as node faults, security attacks, as well as path disconnections. Despite any disruptions or any failures of network components the functionality and performance of the network should remain unaltered. An approach that can assist in resolving the above issues is the use of mobile nodes. In this work, we present a Fault Tolerant Node Placement Algorithm (FTNPA) that utilizes mobile nodes for addressing failures in the network. We initially propose a Mobile Fault Tolerant (MobileFT) Framework, that supplies the two main functionalities of the Fault Tolerant Node Placement Algorithm (FTNPA), which are the detection and the recovery. Then, we present two variations of the FTNPA algorithm, the Decentralized FTNPA and the Centralized FTNPA. The first variation uses a decentralized detection method, where the detection is performed by the neighboring nodes in the network, as well as a local recovery method, where a mobile node is placed in a certain position to assist the affected area. Whereas, the second variation employs a centralized detection method, where the sink is responsible for the detection, and a recovery method that creates alternatives paths of mobile nodes towards a destination node.

12,Intelligent resource allocation in wireless networks: Predictive models for efficient access point management,"With the significant increase in mobile users connected to the wireless network, coupled with the escalating energy consumption and the risk of network saturation, the search for resource management has become paramount. Managing several access points throughout a whole region is hugely relevant in this context. Moreover, a wireless network must keep its Service Level Agreement, regardless of the number of connected users. With that in mind, in this work, we propose four prediction models that allow one to predict the number of connected users on a wireless network. Once the number of users has been predicted, the network resources can be properly allocated, minimizing the number of active access points. We investigate the use of Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithms to hyper-parameterize a Multilayer Perceptron neural network and a Decision Tree. We evaluate our proposal using a campus-based wireless network dataset with more than 20,000 connected users. As a result, our model can considerably improve network performance by intelligently allocating the number of access points, thereby addressing concerns related to energy consumption and network saturation. The results have shown an average accuracy of 95.18%, managing to save network resources effectively.","Lucas R.

13,Protecting unauthenticated messages in LTE/5G mobile networks: A two-level Hierarchical Identity-Based Signature (HIBS) solution,"As an essential public infrastructure, the security and reliability of mobile networks have a profound impact on people’s production and life. Although the security of LTE/5G networks has been improved a lot with the evolution of standards, there are still some unprotected messages being transmitted between the cellular network and device due to the symmetric key-based security architecture and the trade-off between security and other criteria like network availability. By exploiting these messages, various security attacks have been proposed and demonstrated against commercial mobile networks and devices in existing literature, such as user location tracking, bidding-down, and DoS attacks. To address this security issue, in this paper, we aim to protect these unauthenticated messages in mobile networks using digital signatures. Based on the idea of Hierarchical Identity-Based Signature (HIBS) in existing work, we analyse and design a two-level HIBS solution in detail in terms of different aspects such as keys generation and provisioning procedures, replay mitigation, and cell selection. Unlike previous work, our proposed solution also supports the protection of individual vulnerable RRC and NAS layer signalling in addition to authenticating the base station. We evaluated the efficiency and feasibility of several existing HIBS schemes and implemented the most efficient one in the 5G standalone network setup using open-source software. The implementation results further proved the feasibility of the solution in practice.","Chuan Yu, Shuhui Chen, Qianqian Xing, Ziling Wei",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624006467,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,essenti public infrastructur secur reliabl mobil network profound impact peopl ’ product life although secur lte5g network improv lot evolut standard still unprotect messag transmit cellular network devic due symmetr keybas secur architectur tradeoff secur criteria like network avail exploit messag variou secur attack propos demonstr commerci mobil network devic exist literatur user locat track biddingdown do attack address secur issu paper aim protect unauthent messag mobil network use digit signatur base idea hierarch identitybas signatur hib exist work analys design twolevel hib solut detail term differ aspect key gener provis procedur replay mitig cell select unlik previou work propos solut also support protect individu vulner rrc na layer signal addit authent base station evalu effici feasibl sever exist hib scheme implement effici one 5g standalon network setup use opensourc softwar implement result prove feasibl solut practic,protect unauthent messag lte5g mobil network twolevel hierarch identitybas signatur hib solut,protect unauthent messag lte5g mobil network twolevel hierarch identitybas signatur hib solut essenti public infrastructur secur reliabl mobil network profound impact peopl ’ product life although secur lte5g network improv lot evolut standard still unprotect messag transmit cellular network devic due symmetr keybas secur architectur tradeoff secur criteria like network avail exploit messag variou secur attack propos demonstr commerci mobil network devic exist literatur user locat track biddingdown do attack address secur issu paper aim protect unauthent messag mobil network use digit signatur base idea hierarch identitybas signatur hib exist work analys design twolevel hib solut detail term differ aspect key gener provis procedur replay mitig cell select unlik previou work propos solut also support protect individu vulner rrc na layer signal addit authent base station evalu effici feasibl sever exist hib scheme implement effici one 5g standalon network setup use opensourc softwar implement result prove feasibl solut practic
14,NeSt: A QoS differentiating end-to-end networked storage simulator,"The emerging high-speed storage technologies increasingly use Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) protocol to meet their high throughput and low latency needs. In a datacenter environment, applications accessing multiple such devices over the fabric (i.e. the network) tend to have Quality of Service (QoS) requirements pertaining to offered throughput and experienced latency. In this paper we describe a networked storage system simulator called NeSt that supports end-to-end (E2E) QoS differentiation across multiple classes of service. This is done by conveying the class designation end to end and using it to consistently but independently apply the differentiation in each segment of the path. We demonstrate the ability of NeSt to provide end-to-end QoS differentiation under a variety of situations. To the best of our knowledge, NeSt is the first simulator of networked storage (consisting of multiple NVMe SSDs) that supports E2E QoS differentiation.","Jit Gupta, Sourav Das, Krishna Kant",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624006650,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,emerg highspe storag technolog increasingli use nonvolatil memori express nvme protocol meet high throughput low latenc need datacent environ applic access multipl devic fabric ie network tend qualiti servic qo requir pertain offer throughput experienc latenc paper describ network storag system simul call nest support endtoend e2e qo differenti across multipl class servic done convey class design end end use consist independ appli differenti segment path demonstr abil nest provid endtoend qo differenti varieti situat best knowledg nest first simul network storag consist multipl nvme ssd support e2e qo differenti,nest qo differenti endtoend network storag simul,nest qo differenti endtoend network storag simul emerg highspe storag technolog increasingli use nonvolatil memori express nvme protocol meet high throughput low latenc need datacent environ applic access multipl devic fabric ie network tend qualiti servic qo requir pertain offer throughput experienc latenc paper describ network storag system simul call nest support endtoend e2e qo differenti across multipl class servic done convey class design end end use consist independ appli differenti segment path demonstr abil nest provid endtoend qo differenti varieti situat best knowledg nest first simul network storag consist multipl nvme ssd support e2e qo differenti
15,Performance enhancement of NOMA multi-user networks with aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and aerial relay,"In this article, we propose a combination of multiple aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARISs) with an aerial relay (AR) for improving the performance of multiple users adopting the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. In particular, two groups of ARIS are utilized, one for aiding ground-to-air (G2A) communication and another one for aiding air-to-ground (A2G) communication. Mathematical formulas of outage probability (OP), throughput, and achievable capacity (AC) of every user in the proposed ARISs-AR-NOMA network are derived over the Nakagami-
 channel. The propagation environment recommended for the fifth generation and beyond (5G/B5G) is applied to enhance the practical behavior of the proposed network. To confirm the performance enhancement, we compare the OP, throughput, and AC of the proposed system with the conventional AR-NOMA network (i.e., without ARISs). Numerical illustrations demonstrate the great benefits of the proposed ARISs-AR-NOMA network, its transmit power is dramatically lower than that of the conventional network. Moreover, the throughput and AC of the proposed network are considerably higher than the conventional network’s. Based on the effect of key parameters and network behaviors, various effective solutions are recommended to enhance the performance of the proposed ARISs-AR-NOMA network.","Cao Nguyen , Pham Thanh Hiep , Xuan Nam Tran , Nguyen Thu Phuong",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624005991,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,articl propos combin multipl aerial reconfigur intellig surfac ariss aerial relay ar improv perform multipl user adopt nonorthogon multipl access noma scheme particular two group ari util one aid groundtoair g2a commun anoth one aid airtoground a2g commun mathemat formula outag probabl op throughput achiev capac ac everi user propos arissarnoma network deriv nakagami channel propag environ recommend fifth gener beyond 5gb5g appli enhanc practic behavior propos network confirm perform enhanc compar op throughput ac propos system convent arnoma network ie without ariss numer illustr demonstr great benefit propos arissarnoma network transmit power dramat lower convent network moreov throughput ac propos network consider higher convent network ’ base effect key paramet network behavior variou effect solut recommend enhanc perform propos arissarnoma network,perform enhanc noma multius network aerial reconfigur intellig surfac aerial relay,perform enhanc noma multius network aerial reconfigur intellig surfac aerial relay articl propos combin multipl aerial reconfigur intellig surfac ariss aerial relay ar improv perform multipl user adopt nonorthogon multipl access noma scheme particular two group ari util one aid groundtoair g2a commun anoth one aid airtoground a2g commun mathemat formula outag probabl op throughput achiev capac ac everi user propos arissarnoma network deriv nakagami channel propag environ recommend fifth gener beyond 5gb5g appli enhanc practic behavior propos network confirm perform enhanc compar op throughput ac propos system convent arnoma network ie without ariss numer illustr demonstr great benefit propos arissarnoma network transmit power dramat lower convent network moreov throughput ac propos network consider higher convent network ’ base effect key paramet network behavior variou effect solut recommend enhanc perform propos arissarnoma network
16,An intrusion detection method combining variational auto-encoder and generative adversarial networks,"Deep learning is a crucial research area in network security, particularly when it comes to detecting network attacks. While some deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in distinguishing between normal and abnormal traffic, identifying different types of imbalanced anomalous traffic data is still a challenging task at present. To enhance the detection performance of unbalanced anomalous flows, we propose a new intrusion detection architecture based on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) in this research. Firstly, we present the VAE-WGAN model, which combines the advantages of VAE and GAN and enables us to generate data with predefined labels to balance the original training dataset. In the intrusion detection phase, we use a hybrid neural network model based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). Stacked LSTM and MSCNN networks can extract network characteristics at different depths and scales, and subsequent feature fusion is used to increase network attack detection rates. Finally, the results from the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets indicate that the proposed network intrusion detection model improves the accuracy of network attack detection. The model outperforms other existing intrusion detection approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, obtaining 83.45% accuracy and 83.69% f1-score on the NSL-KDD dataset. Moreover, it attains an accuracy and f1-score exceeding 98.9% on the AWID dataset.","Zhengfa Li, Chuanhe Huang, Wanyu Qiu",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624005565,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,deep learn crucial research area network secur particularli come detect network attack deep learn algorithm shown promis result distinguish normal abnorm traffic identifi differ type imbalanc anomal traffic data still challeng task present enhanc detect perform unbalanc anomal flow propos new intrus detect architectur base variat autoencod vae gener adversari network gan research firstli present vaewgan model combin advantag vae gan enabl us gener data predefin label balanc origin train dataset intrus detect phase use hybrid neural network model base stack long shortterm memori lstm multiscal convolut neural network mscnn stack lstm mscnn network extract network characterist differ depth scale subsequ featur fusion use increas network attack detect rate final result nslkdd awid dataset indic propos network intrus detect model improv accuraci network attack detect model outperform exist intrus detect approach term accuraci precis recal f1score obtain 8345 accuraci 8369 f1score nslkdd dataset moreov attain accuraci f1score exceed 989 awid dataset,intrus detect method combin variat autoencod gener adversari network,intrus detect method combin variat autoencod gener adversari network deep learn crucial research area network secur particularli come detect network attack deep learn algorithm shown promis result distinguish normal abnorm traffic identifi differ type imbalanc anomal traffic data still challeng task present enhanc detect perform unbalanc anomal flow propos new intrus detect architectur base variat autoencod vae gener adversari network gan research firstli present vaewgan model combin advantag vae gan enabl us gener data predefin label balanc origin train dataset intrus detect phase use hybrid neural network model base stack long shortterm memori lstm multiscal convolut neural network mscnn stack lstm mscnn network extract network characterist differ depth scale subsequ featur fusion use increas network attack detect rate final result nslkdd awid dataset indic propos network intrus detect model improv accuraci network attack detect model outperform exist intrus detect approach term accuraci precis recal f1score obtain 8345 accuraci 8369 f1score nslkdd dataset moreov attain accuraci f1score exceed 989 awid dataset
17,"NDN multicast over wireless networks: A survey on fundamentals, challenges, and open issues","Wireless devices have shown remarkable growth in data demand in the last decade due to the proliferation of smart devices and the emergence of bandwidth-hungry applications. This increasing data traffic demand is overcrowding the radio frequency spectrum, leading wireless multicast schemes to become a popular research topic again, as they provide efficient data dissemination. NDN supports multicast communication by design. It is a networked system formed by named entities that adopt a communication model focusing on the content rather than its location. The architecture follows a receiver-driven communication model through which content consumers retrieve data through semantically meaningful names instead of specific destinations. Its properties are essential for multicast communication on ad hoc networks, as its features provide enhanced support for dynamic topologies, decentralized control, and the self-organization of participant nodes that communicate without needing a pre-existing network infrastructure. However, despite the wireless medium being broadcast by nature, NDN multicast is still challenging in wireless scenarios, especially in ad hoc environments, due to the node’s high mobility, link instability, constant handovers, and data transmission over a shared medium. Hence, this survey discusses the benefits of NDN for mobile scenarios through an in-depth analysis of NDN multicast features, focusing on fundamentals, challenges, and open issues when applied to wireless networking.","André Luiz R.

18,DDQN-SFCAG: A service function chain recovery method against network attacks in 6G networks,"Service Function Chain (SFC) as an effective solution can satisfy the diverse service requirements of six application scenarios in Network Function Virtualization (NFV)-enabled 6G networks. Resilience as a new key capability indicator in 6G networks puts forward higher requirements for the Quality of Service (QoS) of SFCs. In this article, we study the resilience recovery method in network attack scenarios. We make full use of the monitoring and early warning capability of the monitoring function and propose a proactive recovery method called Double Deep Q-Network based on SFC Attack Graph (DDQN-SFCAG). We fully consider the characteristics of network attacks to generate SFC attack graphs and determine the recovery strategy of SFC according to the service security requirements to provide guidance for recovery. Among them, we design three recovery modes for the recovered Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to determine the optimal recovery strategy and avoid resource waste. We formalize the SFC recovery problem, which aims to minimize the recovery cost while meeting the recovery strategy. In order to shorten the interruption time, we use DDQN to quickly solve the recovery solution to ensure optimal recovery performance. Our extensive evaluation shows DDQN-SFCAG has excellent recovery performance in network attack scenarios and can reduce the recovery cost by at least 31% compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","Deqiang Zhou , Xinsheng Ji , Wei You , Hang Qiu , Yu Zhao , Mingyan Xu",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624005802,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,servic function chain sfc effect solut satisfi divers servic requir six applic scenario network function virtual nfvenabl 6g network resili new key capabl indic 6g network put forward higher requir qualiti servic qo sfc articl studi resili recoveri method network attack scenario make full use monitor earli warn capabl monitor function propos proactiv recoveri method call doubl deep qnetwork base sfc attack graph ddqnsfcag fulli consid characterist network attack gener sfc attack graph determin recoveri strategi sfc accord servic secur requir provid guidanc recoveri among design three recoveri mode recov virtual network function vnf determin optim recoveri strategi avoid resourc wast formal sfc recoveri problem aim minim recoveri cost meet recoveri strategi order shorten interrupt time use ddqn quickli solv recoveri solut ensur optim recoveri perform extens evalu show ddqnsfcag excel recoveri perform network attack scenario reduc recoveri cost least 31 compar stateoftheart method,ddqnsfcag servic function chain recoveri method network attack 6g network,ddqnsfcag servic function chain recoveri method network attack 6g network servic function chain sfc effect solut satisfi divers servic requir six applic scenario network function virtual nfvenabl 6g network resili new key capabl indic 6g network put forward higher requir qualiti servic qo sfc articl studi resili recoveri method network attack scenario make full use monitor earli warn capabl monitor function propos proactiv recoveri method call doubl deep qnetwork base sfc attack graph ddqnsfcag fulli consid characterist network attack gener sfc attack graph determin recoveri strategi sfc accord servic secur requir provid guidanc recoveri among design three recoveri mode recov virtual network function vnf determin optim recoveri strategi avoid resourc wast formal sfc recoveri problem aim minim recoveri cost meet recoveri strategi order shorten interrupt time use ddqn quickli solv recoveri solut ensur optim recoveri perform extens evalu show ddqnsfcag excel recoveri perform network attack scenario reduc recoveri cost least 31 compar stateoftheart method
19,Multi-view multi-label network traffic classification based on MLP-Mixer neural network ,"Network traffic classification is the basis of many network security applications and has received significant attention in the field of cyberspace security. Existing research on deep traffic analysis typically involves converting traffic data into images to extract spatial traffic features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, this approach ignores the semantic differences and details in the various packet structures. In this paper, we propose an MLP-Mixer based multi-view multi-label neural network for network traffic classification. Compared with the existing CNN-based methods, our method adopts the MLP-Mixer structure, which is more in line with the structure of the packet than the conventional convolution operation. In our method, one packet is divided into the packet header and the packet payload, together with the flow statistics of the packet as input from different views.

20,Themis: A passive-active hybrid framework with in-network intelligence for lightweight failure localization,"The fast and efficient failure detection and localization is essential for stable network transmission. Unfortunately, existing schemes suffer from a few drawbacks such as significant resource consumption , lack of support for fast online failure localization, and limited applicable topologies. In this paper, we design Themis, a lightweight learning-based failure localization scheme for general networks. In the data plane, Themis achieves line-speed high performance failure detection using in-network classifiers and fine-grained traffic features. To reduce communication overhead, only coarse-grained traffic features are reported to the control plane for localization when a failure occurs. In the control plane, we propose a two-stage passive-active hybrid failure localization approach to accurately locate the failure without incurring excessive probing traffic. First, passive detection is conducted through the lightweight model XGBoost to infer a Potential Failure Link Set (PFLS). Then, active detection is done by only sending out probing packets to locations in the PFLS for precise failure localization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Themis achieves ms-level failure localization with at least 95.63% accuracy, while saving 87.41% of bandwidth and 41.88% of hardw","Jingyu Xiao , Qing Li ,Dan Zhao , Xudong Zuo , Wenxin Tang , Yong Jiang ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624006686,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,fast effici failur detect local essenti stabl network transmiss unfortun exist scheme suffer drawback signific resourc consumpt lack support fast onlin failur local limit applic topolog paper design themi lightweight learningbas failur local scheme gener network data plane themi achiev linespe high perform failur detect use innetwork classifi finegrain traffic featur reduc commun overhead coarsegrain traffic featur report control plane local failur occur control plane propos twostag passiveact hybrid failur local approach accur locat failur without incur excess probe traffic first passiv detect conduct lightweight model xgboost infer potenti failur link set pfl activ detect done send probe packet locat pfl precis failur local comprehens experi demonstr themi achiev mslevel failur local least 9563 accuraci save 8741 bandwidth 4188 hardw,themi passiveact hybrid framework innetwork intellig lightweight failur local,themi passiveact hybrid framework innetwork intellig lightweight failur local fast effici failur detect local essenti stabl network transmiss unfortun exist scheme suffer drawback signific resourc consumpt lack support fast onlin failur local limit applic topolog paper design themi lightweight learningbas failur local scheme gener network data plane themi achiev linespe high perform failur detect use innetwork classifi finegrain traffic featur reduc commun overhead coarsegrain traffic featur report control plane local failur occur control plane propos twostag passiveact hybrid failur local approach accur locat failur without incur excess probe traffic first passiv detect conduct lightweight model xgboost infer potenti failur link set pfl activ detect done send probe packet locat pfl precis failur local comprehens experi demonstr themi achiev mslevel failur local least 9563 accuraci save 8741 bandwidth 4188 hardw

22,Achieving scalable capacity in wireless mesh networks,"Wireless mesh networks are critical in enabling key networking scenarios in beyond-5G (B5G) and 6G networks, including integrated access and backhaul (IAB), multi-hop sidelinks, and V2X. However, it still poses a challenge to deliver scalable per-node throughput via mesh networking. As shown in Gupta and Kumar’s seminal research (Gupta and Kumar, 2000), multi-hop transmission results in a per-node throughput of  in a wireless network with  nodes, significantly limiting the potential of large-scale deployment of wireless mesh networks. Follow-up research has achieved per-node throughput in a dense network, but how to achieve scalability remains an unresolved issue for an extended wireless network where the network size increases with a constant node density. This issue prevents a wireless mesh network from large-scale deployment. To this end, this paper aims to develop a theoretical approach to achieving scalable per-node throughput in wireless mesh networks. First, the key factors that limit the per-node throughput of wireless mesh networks are analyzed, through which two major ones are identified, i.e., link sharing and interference. Next, a multi-tier hierarchical architecture is proposed to overcome the link-sharing issue. The inter-tier interference under this architecture is then mitigated by utilizing orthogonal frequency allocation between adjacent tiers, while the intra-tier interference is reduced by considering two specific transmission schemes, one is MIMO spatial multiplexing with time-division, the other is MIMO beamforming. Theoretical analysis shows that the multi-tier mesh networking architecture can achieve a per-node throughput of  in both schemes, as long as certain conditions on network parameters including bandwidth, the number of antennas, and the number of nodes of each tier are satisfied. A case study on a realistic deployment of 10,000 nodes is then carried out, which demonstrates that a scalable throughput of  is achievable with a reasonable assumption on bandwidth and the number of antennas.","Lei Lei, Aimin Tang, Xudong Wang",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624005280,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,wireless mesh network critic enabl key network scenario beyond5g b5g 6g network includ integr access backhaul iab multihop sidelink v2x howev still pose challeng deliv scalabl pernod throughput via mesh network shown gupta kumar ’ semin research gupta kumar 2000 multihop transmiss result pernod throughput wireless network node significantli limit potenti largescal deploy wireless mesh network followup research achiev pernod throughput dens network achiev scalabl remain unresolv issu extend wireless network network size increas constant node densiti issu prevent wireless mesh network largescal deploy end paper aim develop theoret approach achiev scalabl pernod throughput wireless mesh network first key factor limit pernod throughput wireless mesh network analyz two major one identifi ie link share interfer next multiti hierarch architectur propos overcom linkshar issu interti interfer architectur mitig util orthogon frequenc alloc adjac tier intrati interfer reduc consid two specif transmiss scheme one mimo spatial multiplex timedivis mimo beamform theoret analysi show multiti mesh network architectur achiev pernod throughput scheme long certain condit network paramet includ bandwidth number antenna number node tier satisfi case studi realist deploy 10000 node carri demonstr scalabl throughput achiev reason assumpt bandwidth number antenna,achiev scalabl capac wireless mesh network,achiev scalabl capac wireless mesh network wireless mesh network critic enabl key network scenario beyond5g b5g 6g network includ integr access backhaul iab multihop sidelink v2x howev still pose challeng deliv scalabl pernod throughput via mesh network shown gupta kumar ’ semin research gupta kumar 2000 multihop transmiss result pernod throughput wireless network node significantli limit potenti largescal deploy wireless mesh network followup research achiev pernod throughput dens network achiev scalabl remain unresolv issu extend wireless network network size increas constant node densiti issu prevent wireless mesh network largescal deploy end paper aim develop theoret approach achiev scalabl pernod throughput wireless mesh network first key factor limit pernod throughput wireless mesh network analyz two major one identifi ie link share interfer next multiti hierarch architectur propos overcom linkshar issu interti interfer architectur mitig util orthogon frequenc alloc adjac tier intrati interfer reduc consid two specif transmiss scheme one mimo spatial multiplex timedivis mimo beamform theoret analysi show multiti mesh network architectur achiev pernod throughput scheme long certain condit network paramet includ bandwidth number antenna number node tier satisfi case studi realist deploy 10000 node carri demonstr scalabl throughput achiev reason assumpt bandwidth number antenna
23,Efficient load distribution in heterogeneous vehicular networks using hierarchical controllers,"Vehicle movement poses significant challenges in vehicular networks, often resulting in uneven traffic distribution. Fog computing (FC) addresses this by operating at the network edge, handling specific tasks locally instead of relying solely on cloud computing (CC) facilities. There are instances where FC may need additional resources and must delegate tasks to CC, leading to increased delay and response time. This work conducts a thorough examination of previous load balancing (LB) strategies, with a specific focus on software-defined networking (SDN) and machine learning (ML) based LB within the internet of vehicles (IoV). The insights derived from this research expedite the development of SDN controller-based LB solutions in the IoV network. The authors proposes the integration of a local SDN controller (LSDNC) within the FC tier to enable localized LB, addressing delay concerns. However, the information will be available to the main SDN controller (MSDNC) too. The authors explore the concept mathematically and simulates the formulated model and subjecting it to a comprehensive performance analysis. The simulation results demonstrate a significant reduction in delay, with a 125 ms difference when 200 onboard units (OBUs) are used, compared to conventional software-defined vehicular networks (SDVN). This improvement continues to increase as the number of OBUs grows. Our model achieves the same maximum throughput as the previous model but delivers faster response times, as decisions are made locally without the need to wait for the main controller.","Phibadeity S.

24,Neural quantile optimization for edge–cloud networking,"We seek the best traffic allocation scheme for the edge–cloud networking subject to SD-WAN architecture and burstable billing. First, we formulate a family of quantile-based integer programming problems for a fixed network topology with random parameters describing the traffic demands. Then, to overcome the difficulty caused by the discrete feature, we generalize the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization method to induce an unconstrained continuous optimization problem as a regularized continuation of the discrete problem. Finally, we introduce the Gumbel-softmax sampling neural network to solve optimization problems via unsupervised learning. The neural network structure reflects the edge–cloud networking topology and is trained to minimize the expectation of the cost function for unconstrained continuous optimization problems. The trained network works as an efficient traffic allocation scheme sampler, outperforming the random strategy in feasibility and cost value. Besides testing the quality of the output allocation scheme, we examine the generalization property of the network by increasing the time steps and the number of users. We also feed the solution to existing integer optimization solvers as initial conditions and verify the warm-starts can accelerate the short-time iteration process. The framework is general, and the decoupled feature of the random neural networks is adequate for practical implementations.","Bin Du , He Zhang , Xiangle Cheng , Lei Zhang",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624005450,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,seek best traffic alloc scheme edge–cloud network subject sdwan architectur burstabl bill first formul famili quantilebas integ program problem fix network topolog random paramet describ traffic demand overcom difficulti caus discret featur gener gumbelsoftmax reparameter method induc unconstrain continu optim problem regular continu discret problem final introduc gumbelsoftmax sampl neural network solv optim problem via unsupervis learn neural network structur reflect edge–cloud network topolog train minim expect cost function unconstrain continu optim problem train network work effici traffic alloc scheme sampler outperform random strategi feasibl cost valu besid test qualiti output alloc scheme examin gener properti network increas time step number user also feed solut exist integ optim solver initi condit verifi warmstart acceler shorttim iter process framework gener decoupl featur random neural network adequ practic implement,neural quantil optim edge–cloud network,neural quantil optim edge–cloud network seek best traffic alloc scheme edge–cloud network subject sdwan architectur burstabl bill first formul famili quantilebas integ program problem fix network topolog random paramet describ traffic demand overcom difficulti caus discret featur gener gumbelsoftmax reparameter method induc unconstrain continu optim problem regular continu discret problem final introduc gumbelsoftmax sampl neural network solv optim problem via unsupervis learn neural network structur reflect edge–cloud network topolog train minim expect cost function unconstrain continu optim problem train network work effici traffic alloc scheme sampler outperform random strategi feasibl cost valu besid test qualiti output alloc scheme examin gener properti network increas time step number user also feed solut exist integ optim solver initi condit verifi warmstart acceler shorttim iter process framework gener decoupl featur random neural network adequ practic implement
25,PETIT: PUF-enabled trust evaluation framework for IoT networks,"Internet-of-Things (IoT) is characterized by the incorporation of resource constrained devices that are inter-networked in an ad-hoc manner. Given the diversity of the devices and the operating conditions, it is important to assess the trustworthiness of IoT nodes and factor it in the network management. Contemporary trust evaluation and management schemes found in the literature mostly consider observable network-level behavior parameters and initially assume that all nodes are equally trustworthy owing to the absence of historical data or background. Such an equal trust initialization approach raises concerns in terms of accuracy, fairness, and adaptability. This paper aims to mitigate these shortcomings by proposing a novel trust evaluation and aggregation framework. Our framework leverages hardware primitives such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to assign trust scores at the network bootstrapping phase. The paper explores the establishment of both direct and recommendation based indirect trust score evaluation and detection of irregularities to ensure the dynamic, safe, and reliable operation of the network. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that the trust value computed through this mechanism effectively and precisely mirrors the node’s credibility.","Suhee Sanjana Mehjabin , Mohamed Younis ,Ali Tekeoglu , Mohammad Ebrahimabadi , Tamim Sookoor , Naghmeh Karimi",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624006042,Networking and Cyber Security,https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?qs=networking&pub=Computer%20Networks&cid=271990,,,internetofth iot character incorpor resourc constrain devic internetwork adhoc manner given divers devic oper condit import assess trustworthi iot node factor network manag contemporari trust evalu manag scheme found literatur mostli consid observ networklevel behavior paramet initi assum node equal trustworthi owe absenc histor data background equal trust initi approach rais concern term accuraci fair adapt paper aim mitig shortcom propos novel trust evalu aggreg framework framework leverag hardwar primit physic unclon function puf assign trust score network bootstrap phase paper explor establish direct recommend base indirect trust score evalu detect irregular ensur dynam safe reliabl oper network simul outcom demonstr trust valu comput mechan effect precis mirror node ’ credibl,petit pufen trust evalu framework iot network,petit pufen trust evalu framework iot network internetofth iot character incorpor resourc constrain devic internetwork adhoc manner given divers devic oper condit import assess trustworthi iot node factor network manag contemporari trust evalu manag scheme found literatur mostli consid observ networklevel behavior paramet initi assum node equal trustworthi owe absenc histor data background equal trust initi approach rais concern term accuraci fair adapt paper aim mitig shortcom propos novel trust evalu aggreg framework framework leverag hardwar primit physic unclon function puf assign trust score network bootstrap phase paper explor establish direct recommend base indirect trust score evalu detect irregular ensur dynam safe reliabl oper network simul outcom demonstr trust valu comput mechan effect precis mirror node ’ credibl
26,Novel modeling and optimization for joint Cybersecurity-vs-QoS Intrusion Detection Mechanisms in 5G networks,"The rapid emergence of 5G technology brings new cybersecurity challenges that hold significant implications for our economy, society, and environment. Among these challenges, ensuring the effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Mechanisms (IDMs) in monitoring networks and detecting 5G-related cyberattacks is of utmost importance. However, optimizing cybersecurity levels and selecting appropriate IDMs remain as critical and ongoing challenges. This work considers multiple pre-deployed distributed Security Agents (SAs) across the network, each capable of running various IDMs, where they differ by their effectiveness in detecting the attacks (referred to as security term) and the consumption of resources (referred to as Quality of Service (QoS) costs). We formulate a joint security and QoS utility function leveraging the Cobb–Douglas production utility function. There are several parameters that impact the joint objective problem, including the set of elasticity parameters, that reflect the importance of the two objectives. We derive an optimal set of elasticity parameters in closed form to identify the balancing point where both objectives have equal utility values. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that increasing the detection level of SAs enhances the security utility while simultaneously diminishing the QoS utility, as more computational, bandwidth, and monetary resources are utilized for IDM processing. After optimization, our mechanism can strike an effective balance between cybersecurity and QoS overhead while demonstrating the importance of different parameters in the joint problem.","Arash Bozorgchenani , Charilaos C.

27,Surveying cybersecurity vulnerabilities and countermeasures for enhancing UAV security,"Drones and other forms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usages are increasing with time from military operations like surveillance, reconnaissance to commercial operations such as transportation, agriculture. The Drone market will be grown to around 43 billion USD by the 2025. With the increase in the usages, there is increase in cyber-attacks. So, Drone security and privacy are of major concern as they are used to perform the critical operations. The rapid adoption of UAVs in various sectors has prompted the need for robust and comprehensive cyber security measures. By implementing robust countermeasures, such as authentication, encryption etc. the risks posed by cyber threats can be significantly mitigated.

28,"A survey on deep learning for cybersecurity: Progress, challenges, and opportunities","As the number of Internet-connected systems rises, cyber analysts find it increasingly difficult to effectively monitor the produced volume of data, its velocity and diversity. Signature-based cybersecurity strategies are unlikely to achieve the required performance for detecting new attack vectors. Moreover, technological advances enable attackers to develop sophisticated attack strategies that can avoid detection by current security systems. As the cyber-threat landscape worsens, we need advanced tools and technologies to detect, investigate, and make quick decisions regarding emerging attacks and threats. Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to analyze and automatically classify vast amounts of Internet traffic. AI-based solutions that automate the detection of attacks and tackle complex cybersecurity problems are gaining increasing attention. This paper comprehensively presents the promising applications of deep learning, a subfield of AI based on multiple layers of artificial neural networks, in a wide variety of security tasks.

29,A differential game view of antagonistic dynamics for cybersecurity,"A fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the antagonism between the attacker and the defender can strengthen forward-looking and strategic planning for the cybersecurity. Most of the existing works have one or more of the following limitations: static modeling, non co-evolved strategy and synchronized setting, not accounting for the dynamic nature of the cyber arms race between the defensive and offensive sides. In this paper, we apply differential game theory to analyze the antagonistic dynamics between the attacker and the defender and study two complementary game theoretic formulations, namely the black-box game the and the white-box game: The black-box game can cogently model the opaque-information confrontation and the white-box one is capable to depict the partially transparent-information confrontation. To gain insight into the evolution rule of the antagonistic dynamics between the defensive and the offensive sides, we establish the existence of the Nash equilibrium and the corresponding conditions in the black-box game. Moreover, an iteration algorithm is designed to find the numerical solutions of the Nash equilibrium in the general case and further its analytical solutions in a special case for the white-box game. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed games.","Shengling Wang , Yu Pu , Hongwei Shi , Jianhui Huang , Yinhao Xiao ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128621004357,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,fundament understand dynam antagon attack defend strengthen forwardlook strateg plan cybersecur exist work one follow limit static model non coevolv strategi synchron set account dynam natur cyber arm race defens offens side paper appli differenti game theori analyz antagonist dynam attack defend studi two complementari game theoret formul name blackbox game whitebox game blackbox game cogent model opaqueinform confront whitebox one capabl depict partial transparentinform confront gain insight evolut rule antagonist dynam defens offens side establish exist nash equilibrium correspond condit blackbox game moreov iter algorithm design find numer solut nash equilibrium gener case analyt solut special case whitebox game extens numer simul carri evalu perform propos game,differenti game view antagonist dynam cybersecur,differenti game view antagonist dynam cybersecur fundament understand dynam antagon attack defend strengthen forwardlook strateg plan cybersecur exist work one follow limit static model non coevolv strategi synchron set account dynam natur cyber arm race defens offens side paper appli differenti game theori analyz antagonist dynam attack defend studi two complementari game theoret formul name blackbox game whitebox game blackbox game cogent model opaqueinform confront whitebox one capabl depict partial transparentinform confront gain insight evolut rule antagonist dynam defens offens side establish exist nash equilibrium correspond condit blackbox game moreov iter algorithm design find numer solut nash equilibrium gener case analyt solut special case whitebox game extens numer simul carri evalu perform propos game

We review possible cyber attacks on ICSs, identify typical threats and vulnerabilities, and we discuss unresolved security issues with existing ICS cybersecurity solutions. Then, we discuss how to secure ICSs (e.g., using risk assessment methodologies) and other protection measures.

31,A systematic evaluation of cybersecurity metrics for dynamic networks,"It is difficult to assess the security of modern networks because they are usually dynamic with configuration changes (such as changes in topology, firewall rules, etc). Graphical security models (e.g., Attack Graphs and Attack Trees) are widely used to systematically analyse the security posture of network systems using security metrics. However, there are problems using them to assess the security of dynamic networks. First, most models are unable to capture dynamic changes occurring in the networks over time. Second, the existing security metrics are not designed for the analysis of dynamic networks and hence their effectiveness to the dynamic changes in the network still remains unclear.
In this paper, we systematically categorise network changes into two categories (i.e., changes in hosts and changes in edges). We conduct a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of security metrics using a Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model, which can capture and analyse the changes in the security of network systems. Further, we investigate the varying effects of security metrics when changes are observed in the dynamic networks.
Our simulation results show that different security metrics (except the shortest attack path) have varying security posture changes with respect to changes in the network (when we introduce time to them). However, none of the security metrics consistently changes for all the network changes that we observe in our scenarios. Hence, the results provide some insights into what security metrics can change (accordingly) when a particular network change is observed. It also provides a foundation for further research in this area.","Simon Yusuf Enoch , Mengmeng Ge , Jin B.

32,CGAN-based cyber deception framework against reconnaissance attacks in ICS,"In recent years, Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have faced increasing vulnerability to cyber attacks due to their integration with the Internet. Despite efforts to enhance cybersecurity, reconnaissance attacks remain a significant threat, prompting the need for innovative defensive strategies. This paper introduces a novel approach to strengthen the defensive capabilities of ICS networks against reconnaissance attacks using machine learning-driven cyber deception techniques. Leveraging Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs), the proposed framework dynamically generates defensive network topologies to network shuffling and implement deception strategies, prioritizing system availability. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior efficacy of the proposed framework in enhancing cybersecurity while minimizing computational overhead. By effectively mitigating reconnaissance attacks, this solution reinforces the resilience of ICS networks, safeguarding critical industrial infrastructure from evolving cyber threats.

33,A generic learning simulation framework to assess security strategies in cyber-physical production systems,"Connected systems through computerized networks are at the heart of the Industry of the future. As they merge physical entities with cyber spaces, they fall under the paradigm of cyber-physical production systems. Cybersecurity is a key challenge for such systems, as they are subject to daily attempts of intruders to gain unauthorized access to their internal resources or to compromise their integrity. The fast increase of new attack strategies requires the rapid design and assessment of new defense strategies. It entails a complex, error-prone and time-consuming process, including the clear specification of the attack and defense strategies involved, and the design and implementation of the simulation model allowing to evaluate the performances of the defense strategy. This work intends to make such a process transparent to cybersecurity managers by limiting their workload to the sole specification of the characteristics of the system and the logic of the attack and the defense. It provides a generic hybrid simulation framework for flexible evaluation of cybersecurity policies, which is demonstrated on a SYN flooding application. Therefore, the contribution is twofold: (1) The proposed framework offers a high-level environment allowing various experts to collaborate by graphically modeling a given attack strategy and the envisioned defense strategy, without engaging in heavy implementation efforts. Then the framework's executable infrastructure, which combines simulation with machine learning to understanding the interactions between the attackers & the defender, will allow them assessing the performances of these strategies. The proposed framework differs from state-of-the-art cybersecurity simulation environments in its uniqueness to combining the expressive power of a universal simulation modeling formalism with the user-friendliness of a visual simulation tool. Therefore, it offers at one side, a very high modeling flexibility for easy exploration of various cybersecurity strategies, and at the other side, integrated learning capabilities for allowing self-adaptive user-based cybersecurity strategy design. (2) The application demonstrating the framework focuses on the most encountered and still uncontrolled threats in cybersecurity, i.e. the SYN-Flooding based Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The application targeted is not meant to propose yet another SYN flood detection algorithm or to improve the state-of-the-art in that domain, but to prove the framework operationality. The experimental results obtained showcase the ability of the framework to support learning simulation-based SYN flood defense algorithm design and validation.","Moussa Koïta , Youssouf M.

34,SPEAR SIEM: A Security Information and Event Management system for the Smart Grid,"The technological leap of smart technologies has brought the conventional electrical grid in a new digital era called Smart Grid (SG), providing multiple benefits, such as two-way communication, pervasive control and self-healing. However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cybersecurity in mind. Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates severe cybersecurity challenges. The Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems constitute an emerging technology in the cybersecurity area, having the capability to detect, normalise and correlate a vast amount of security events. They can orchestrate the entire security of a smart ecosystem, such as SG. Nevertheless, the current SIEM systems do not take into account the unique SG peculiarities and characteristics like the legacy communication protocols. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) SIEM, which focuses on SG. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a SIEM system capable of detecting, normalising and correlating cyberattacks and anomalies against a plethora of SG application-layer protocols. It is noteworthy that the detection performance of the SPEAR SIEM is demonstrated with real data originating from four real SG use case (a) hydropower plant, (b) substation, (c) power plant and (d) smart home.","Panagiotis Radoglou-Grammatikis , Panagiotis Sarigiannidis ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128621001237,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,technolog leap smart technolog brought convent electr grid new digit era call smart grid sg provid multipl benefit twoway commun pervas control selfheal howev new realiti gener signific cybersecur risk due heterogen insecur natur sg particular sg reli legaci commun protocol implement cybersecur mind moreov advent internet thing iot creat sever cybersecur challeng secur inform event manag siem system constitut emerg technolog cybersecur area capabl detect normalis correl vast amount secur event orchestr entir secur smart ecosystem sg nevertheless current siem system take account uniqu sg peculiar characterist like legaci commun protocol paper present secur privat smart grid spear siem focus sg main contribut work design implement siem system capabl detect normalis correl cyberattack anomali plethora sg applicationlay protocol noteworthi detect perform spear siem demonstr real data origin four real sg use case hydropow plant b substat c power plant smart home,spear siem secur inform event manag system smart grid,spear siem secur inform event manag system smart grid technolog leap smart technolog brought convent electr grid new digit era call smart grid sg provid multipl benefit twoway commun pervas control selfheal howev new realiti gener signific cybersecur risk due heterogen insecur natur sg particular sg reli legaci commun protocol implement cybersecur mind moreov advent internet thing iot creat sever cybersecur challeng secur inform event manag siem system constitut emerg technolog cybersecur area capabl detect normalis correl vast amount secur event orchestr entir secur smart ecosystem sg nevertheless current siem system take account uniqu sg peculiar characterist like legaci commun protocol paper present secur privat smart grid spear siem focus sg main contribut work design implement siem system capabl detect normalis correl cyberattack anomali plethora sg applicationlay protocol noteworthi detect perform spear siem demonstr real data origin four real sg use case hydropow plant b substat c power plant smart home
35,AAE-DSVDD: A one-class classification model for VPN traffic identification,"Virtual Private Network(VPN) can provide a concealed transmission channel for communication and protect the privacy of users. However, it also brings hidden dangers to cybersecurity with its wide application. Malicious behavior or harmful information can be transmitted secretly through VPN tunnels to avoid firewall censorship. Therefore, VPN traffic identification is an important part of ensure cybersecurity. Although many efforts have been made for VPN traffic identification, existing methods mainly focus on supervised learning models. In this paper, we propose an one-class classification model called AAE-DSVDD for VPN traffic identification. First, we introduce Adversarial AutoEncoder(AAE) for preliminary modeling of VPN traffic. AAE can match the aggregated posterior distribution of the hidden layer to an arbitrary prior distribution. It associates the samples with a normal distribution in the hidden space. Secondly, We implement representation learning for VPN traffic via Deep Support Vector Data Description(DSVDD). A standardized method is designed to match the output distribution of DSVDD with the aggregated posterior distribution of AAE. It alleviates the hypersphere collapse problem of DSVDD and improves identification performance. Finally, we verify the abilities of the AAE-DSVDD model on the public dataset ISCXVPN. Compared with other one-class models, AAE-DSVDD achieved the best identification ability for VPN traffic identification. It also improves the recognition ability when identifying strange classes that are not included in the training data.","Sicai Lv, Chao Wang , Zibo Wang ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128623004358,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,virtual privat networkvpn provid conceal transmiss channel commun protect privaci user howev also bring hidden danger cybersecur wide applic malici behavior harm inform transmit secretli vpn tunnel avoid firewal censorship therefor vpn traffic identif import part ensur cybersecur although mani effort made vpn traffic identif exist method mainli focu supervis learn model paper propos oneclass classif model call aaedsvdd vpn traffic identif first introduc adversari autoencoderaa preliminari model vpn traffic aae match aggreg posterior distribut hidden layer arbitrari prior distribut associ sampl normal distribut hidden space secondli implement represent learn vpn traffic via deep support vector data descriptiondsvdd standard method design match output distribut dsvdd aggreg posterior distribut aae allevi hyperspher collaps problem dsvdd improv identif perform final verifi abil aaedsvdd model public dataset iscxvpn compar oneclass model aaedsvdd achiev best identif abil vpn traffic identif also improv recognit abil identifi strang class includ train data,aaedsvdd oneclass classif model vpn traffic identif,aaedsvdd oneclass classif model vpn traffic identif virtual privat networkvpn provid conceal transmiss channel commun protect privaci user howev also bring hidden danger cybersecur wide applic malici behavior harm inform transmit secretli vpn tunnel avoid firewal censorship therefor vpn traffic identif import part ensur cybersecur although mani effort made vpn traffic identif exist method mainli focu supervis learn model paper propos oneclass classif model call aaedsvdd vpn traffic identif first introduc adversari autoencoderaa preliminari model vpn traffic aae match aggreg posterior distribut hidden layer arbitrari prior distribut associ sampl normal distribut hidden space secondli implement represent learn vpn traffic via deep support vector data descriptiondsvdd standard method design match output distribut dsvdd aggreg posterior distribut aae allevi hyperspher collaps problem dsvdd improv identif perform final verifi abil aaedsvdd model public dataset iscxvpn compar oneclass model aaedsvdd achiev best identif abil vpn traffic identif also improv recognit abil identifi strang class includ train data
36,DoS/DDoS-MQTT-IoT: A dataset for evaluating intrusions in IoT networks using the MQTT protocol,"Adversaries may exploit a range of vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These vulnerabilities are typically exploited to carry out attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, either against the IoT devices themselves, or using the devices to perform the attacks. These attacks are often successful due to the nature of the protocols used in the IoT. One popular protocol used for machine-to-machine IoT communications is the Message Queueing Telemetry Protocol (MQTT). Countermeasures for attacks against MQTT include testing defenses with existing datasets. However, there is a lack of real-world test datasets in this area. For this reason, this paper introduces a DoS/DDoS-MQTT-IoT dataset—that contains various DoS/DDoS attack scenarios using MQTT traffic—to help develop and test countermeasures against such attacks. To this end, a physical IoT testbed was constructed and a large volume of IoT data was generated that included standard MQTT traffic as well as 10 DoS scenarios. The usability of the dataset has been evaluated via machine learning.","Alaa Alatram, Leslie F.

37,Towards a Cyber Resilience Quantification Framework (CRQF) for IT infrastructure,"Cyber resilience quantification is the process of evaluating and measuring an organisation’s ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from cyber-attacks. It involves estimating IT systems, networks, and response strategies to ensure robust defence and effective recovery mechanisms in the event of a cyber-attack. Quantifying cyber resilience can be difficult due to the constantly changing components of IT infrastructure. Traditional methods like vulnerability assessments and penetration testing may not be effective. Measuring cyber resilience is essential to evaluate and strengthen an organisation’s preparedness against evolving cyber-attacks. It helps identify weaknesses, allocate resources, and ensure the uninterrupted operation of critical systems and information. There are various methods for measuring cyber resilience, such as evaluating, teaming and testing, and creating simulated models. This article proposes a cyber resilience quantification framework for IT infrastructure that utilises a simulation approach. This approach enables organisations to simulate different attack scenarios, identify vulnerabilities, and improve their cyber resilience. The comparative analysis of cyber resilience factors highlights pre-configuration’s robust planning and adaptation (61.44%), buffering supported’s initial readiness (44.53%), and network topologies’ robust planning but weak recovery and adaptation (60.04% to 77.86%), underscoring the need for comprehensive enhancements across all phases. The utilisation of the proposed factors is crucial in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of IT infrastructure in the event of a cyber-attack.","Saleh Mohamed AlHidaifi, Muhammad Rizwan Asghar, Imran Shafique Ansari ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624002780,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,cyber resili quantif process evalu measur organis ’ abil withstand adapt recov cyberattack involv estim system network respons strategi ensur robust defenc effect recoveri mechan event cyberattack quantifi cyber resili difficult due constantli chang compon infrastructur tradit method like vulner assess penetr test may effect measur cyber resili essenti evalu strengthen organis ’ prepared evolv cyberattack help identifi weak alloc resourc ensur uninterrupt oper critic system inform variou method measur cyber resili evalu team test creat simul model articl propos cyber resili quantif framework infrastructur utilis simul approach approach enabl organis simul differ attack scenario identifi vulner improv cyber resili compar analysi cyber resili factor highlight preconfigur ’ robust plan adapt 6144 buffer support ’ initi readi 4453 network topolog ’ robust plan weak recoveri adapt 6004 7786 underscor need comprehens enhanc across phase utilis propos factor crucial conduct comprehens evalu infrastructur event cyberattack,toward cyber resili quantif framework crqf infrastructur,toward cyber resili quantif framework crqf infrastructur cyber resili quantif process evalu measur organis ’ abil withstand adapt recov cyberattack involv estim system network respons strategi ensur robust defenc effect recoveri mechan event cyberattack quantifi cyber resili difficult due constantli chang compon infrastructur tradit method like vulner assess penetr test may effect measur cyber resili essenti evalu strengthen organis ’ prepared evolv cyberattack help identifi weak alloc resourc ensur uninterrupt oper critic system inform variou method measur cyber resili evalu team test creat simul model articl propos cyber resili quantif framework infrastructur utilis simul approach approach enabl organis simul differ attack scenario identifi vulner improv cyber resili compar analysi cyber resili factor highlight preconfigur ’ robust plan adapt 6144 buffer support ’ initi readi 4453 network topolog ’ robust plan weak recoveri adapt 6004 7786 underscor need comprehens enhanc across phase utilis propos factor crucial conduct comprehens evalu infrastructur event cyberattack

39,FTG-Net-E: A hierarchical ensemble graph neural network for DDoS attack detection,"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are a major threat to computer networks. These attacks can be carried out by flooding a network with malicious traffic, overwhelming its resources, and/or making it unavailable to legitimate users. Existing machine learning methods for DDoS attack detection typically use statistical features of network traffic, such as packet sizes and inter-arrival times. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between different traffic flows. This paper proposes a new DDoS attack detection approach that uses Graph Neural Networks (GNN) ensemble learning. GNN ensemble learning is a type of machine learning that combines multiple GNN models to improve the detection accuracy. We evaluated our approach on the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CICIDS2018) and CICIDS2017 datasets, a benchmark dataset for DDoS attack detection. Our work provides two main contributions. First, we extend our DDoS attack detection approach using GNN ensemble learning. Second, we explore the evaluation and fine-tuning of hyperparameter metrics through ensemble learning, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to a single GNN model and achieving an average 3.2% higher F1-score. Additionally, our approach effectively reduces overfitting by incorporating regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping. Specifically, we use a hierarchical ensemble of GNN, where each GNN learns the relationships between traffic flows at a different granularity level. We then use bagging and boosting to combine the predictions of the individual GNN, further improving detection accuracy. Results show that our system can achieve 99.67% accuracy, with a F1-score of 99.29%, which is better than state-of-the-art methods, even using single traffic architecture.","Rana Abu Bakar , Lorenzo De Marinis , Filippo Cugini , Francesco Paolucci ,Show more",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624003402,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,distribut denialofservic ddo attack major threat comput network attack carri flood network malici traffic overwhelm resourc andor make unavail legitim user exist machin learn method ddo attack detect typic use statist featur network traffic packet size interarriv time howev method often fail captur complex relationship differ traffic flow paper propos new ddo attack detect approach use graph neural network gnn ensembl learn gnn ensembl learn type machin learn combin multipl gnn model improv detect accuraci evalu approach canadian institut cybersecur intrus detect evalu dataset cicids2018 cicids2017 dataset benchmark dataset ddo attack detect work provid two main contribut first extend ddo attack detect approach use gnn ensembl learn second explor evalu finetun hyperparamet metric ensembl learn significantli enhanc accuraci compar singl gnn model achiev averag 32 higher f1score addit approach effect reduc overfit incorpor regular techniqu dropout earli stop specif use hierarch ensembl gnn gnn learn relationship traffic flow differ granular level use bag boost combin predict individu gnn improv detect accuraci result show system achiev 9967 accuraci f1score 9929 better stateoftheart method even use singl traffic architectur,ftgnete hierarch ensembl graph neural network ddo attack detect,ftgnete hierarch ensembl graph neural network ddo attack detect distribut denialofservic ddo attack major threat comput network attack carri flood network malici traffic overwhelm resourc andor make unavail legitim user exist machin learn method ddo attack detect typic use statist featur network traffic packet size interarriv time howev method often fail captur complex relationship differ traffic flow paper propos new ddo attack detect approach use graph neural network gnn ensembl learn gnn ensembl learn type machin learn combin multipl gnn model improv detect accuraci evalu approach canadian institut cybersecur intrus detect evalu dataset cicids2018 cicids2017 dataset benchmark dataset ddo attack detect work provid two main contribut first extend ddo attack detect approach use gnn ensembl learn second explor evalu finetun hyperparamet metric ensembl learn significantli enhanc accuraci compar singl gnn model achiev averag 32 higher f1score addit approach effect reduc overfit incorpor regular techniqu dropout earli stop specif use hierarch ensembl gnn gnn learn relationship traffic flow differ granular level use bag boost combin predict individu gnn improv detect accuraci result show system achiev 9967 accuraci f1score 9929 better stateoftheart method even use singl traffic architectur
40,"Distributed denial of service attack prediction: Challenges, open issues and opportunities","Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the biggest cyber threats. DDoS attacks have evolved in quantity and volume to evade detection and increase damage.

41,Passive operating system fingerprinting revisited: Evaluation and current challenges,"Fingerprinting a host's operating system is a very common yet precarious task in network, asset, and vulnerability management. Estimating the operating system via network traffic analysis may leverage TCP/IP header parameters or complex analysis of hosts' behavior using machine learning. However, the existing approaches are becoming obsolete as network traffic evolves which makes the problem still open. This paper discusses various approaches to passive OS fingerprinting and their evolution in the past twenty years. We illustrate their usage, compare their results in an experiment, and list challenges faced by the current fingerprinting approaches. The hosts' differences in network stack settings were initially the most important information source for OS fingerprinting, which is now complemented by hosts' behavioral analysis and combined approaches backed by machine learning. The most impactful reasons for this evolution were the Internet-wide network traffic encryption and the general adoption of privacy-preserving concepts in application protocols. Other changes, such as the increasing proliferation of web applications on handheld devices, raised the need to identify these devices in the networks, for which we may use the techniques of OS fingerprinting.","Martin Laštovička, Martin Husák, Petr Velan, Tomáš Jirsík, Pavel Čeleda",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138912862300227X,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,fingerprint host oper system common yet precari task network asset vulner manag estim oper system via network traffic analysi may leverag tcpip header paramet complex analysi host behavior use machin learn howev exist approach becom obsolet network traffic evolv make problem still open paper discuss variou approach passiv os fingerprint evolut past twenti year illustr usag compar result experi list challeng face current fingerprint approach host differ network stack set initi import inform sourc os fingerprint complement host behavior analysi combin approach back machin learn impact reason evolut internetwid network traffic encrypt gener adopt privacypreserv concept applic protocol chang increas prolifer web applic handheld devic rais need identifi devic network may use techniqu os fingerprint,passiv oper system fingerprint revisit evalu current challeng,passiv oper system fingerprint revisit evalu current challeng fingerprint host oper system common yet precari task network asset vulner manag estim oper system via network traffic analysi may leverag tcpip header paramet complex analysi host behavior use machin learn howev exist approach becom obsolet network traffic evolv make problem still open paper discuss variou approach passiv os fingerprint evolut past twenti year illustr usag compar result experi list challeng face current fingerprint approach host differ network stack set initi import inform sourc os fingerprint complement host behavior analysi combin approach back machin learn impact reason evolut internetwid network traffic encrypt gener adopt privacypreserv concept applic protocol chang increas prolifer web applic handheld devic rais need identifi devic network may use techniqu os fingerprint
42,"Satellite-based communications security: A survey of threats, solutions, and research challenges ","Satellite-based Communication (SATCOM) systems are gaining renewed momentum in Industry and Academia, thanks to innovative services introduced by leading tech companies and the promising impact they can deliver towards the global connectivity objective tackled by early 6G initiatives. On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services.
In this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified branches, focusing on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based key distribution schemes. For each of the above domains, we highlight the most essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned, and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers and investors, ultimately unleashing the full potential behind ubiquitous satellite communications.","ietro Tedeschi , Savio Sciancalepore",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138912862200319X,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,satellitebas commun satcom system gain renew momentum industri academia thank innov servic introduc lead tech compani promis impact deliv toward global connect object tackl earli 6g initi one hand emerg new manufactur process radio technolog promis reduc servic cost guarante outstand commun latenc avail bandwidth flexibl coverag rang hand cybersecur techniqu solut appli satcom link updat reflect substanti advanc attack capabl character last two decad howev busi urgenc opportun lead oper toward challeng system tradeoff result increas attack surfac gener relax avail secur servic paper tackl cite problem present comprehens survey linklay secur threat solut challeng face deploy oper satcom system specif classifi literatur secur satcom system two main branch ie physicallay secur cryptographi scheme identifi specif research domain identifi branch focus dedic secur issu includ eg physicallay confidenti antijam scheme antispoof strategi quantumbas key distribut scheme domain highlight essenti techniqu peculiar advantag disadvantag lesson learn futur direct final also identifi emerg research topic whose addit investig academia industri could attract research investor ultim unleash full potenti behind ubiquit satellit commun,satellitebas commun secur survey threat solut research challeng,satellitebas commun secur survey threat solut research challeng satellitebas commun satcom system gain renew momentum industri academia thank innov servic introduc lead tech compani promis impact deliv toward global connect object tackl earli 6g initi one hand emerg new manufactur process radio technolog promis reduc servic cost guarante outstand commun latenc avail bandwidth flexibl coverag rang hand cybersecur techniqu solut appli satcom link updat reflect substanti advanc attack capabl character last two decad howev busi urgenc opportun lead oper toward challeng system tradeoff result increas attack surfac gener relax avail secur servic paper tackl cite problem present comprehens survey linklay secur threat solut challeng face deploy oper satcom system specif classifi literatur secur satcom system two main branch ie physicallay secur cryptographi scheme identifi specif research domain identifi branch focus dedic secur issu includ eg physicallay confidenti antijam scheme antispoof strategi quantumbas key distribut scheme domain highlight essenti techniqu peculiar advantag disadvantag lesson learn futur direct final also identifi emerg research topic whose addit investig academia industri could attract research investor ultim unleash full potenti behind ubiquit satellit commun
43,"A survey on network simulators, emulators, and testbeds used for research and education","Network operators and researchers constantly search for platforms to evaluate future deployments and test new research ideas. When experimenting, they usually face challenges in deciding on an appropriate platform to validate the advantages and limitations of their proposed system. These challenges include finding an experimentation environment that balances traffic realism, scalability, and cost. An experimenter can evaluate systems, protocols, and security implementations using simulators, emulators, or testbeds to validate the expected behavior of the proposed idea. Simulators and emulators provide a controlled environment to conduct reproducible experiments but lack realism. Testbeds provide realism and scale depending on the available resources. However, real equipment can be costly and unavailable for many experimenters. The inability to test networking ideas in a realistic environment at a large scale presents a barrier for companies, institutions, and network vendors to implement new features, thus, slowing down innovation. In the past few decades, the networking community developed new platforms to test new ideas and deployments at scale, with realism, and at lower costs. These platforms also enable the instruction of networking concepts, cybersecurity, distributed computing, storage systems, and science applications. From the learner’s side, practical hands-on experience is required to internalize concepts and improve troubleshooting skills. Learning these concepts can be challenging due to the multidisciplinary nature of networking instruction, where a learner must have a background in several computing areas (e.g., operating systems, programming languages, and computer architecture). This paper presents experimentation platforms used to conduct research in computer networks and evaluates the potential of these platforms for instructing networking courses. This paper examines the literature and presents a taxonomy of network experimentation platforms.

44,Efficient intrusion detection toward IoT networks using cloud–edge collaboration,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly utilized in daily life and industrial production, particularly in critical infrastructures. IoT cybersecurity has an effect on people’s safety, national security, and economic growth. However, the traditional cloud-based centralized intrusion detection methods cannot satisfy the demands for data privacy, network load, and timely response. In this article, we proposed an efficient intrusion detection method based on cloud–edge collaboration. The approach can reduce computational workload to speed up model training, prevent data privacy leakage, enrich training data, and detect attacks unknown to local edge devices. Specifically, stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is first utilized for data dimensionality reduction to overcome the bottleneck of resource constraints on edge devices. Second, considering the long-term serial characteristics of IoT traffic data, the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model is employed to detect attack; Finally, the cloud–edge collaboration architecture based on federated learning is used to coordinate multi-party training intrusion detection models. It fills the gap of missed detection by intrusion detection models due to data silos. Experiments show that our method reduced the training time, storage and memory required for the model training process by more than 50%, respectively, but the detection accuracy is close to centralized trained models. The model trained based on cloud–edge collaboration can identify attacks unknown to local edge devices.","Run Yang  , Hui He a",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138912862300169X,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,internet thing iot increasingli util daili life industri product particularli critic infrastructur iot cybersecur effect peopl ’ safeti nation secur econom growth howev tradit cloudbas central intrus detect method satisfi demand data privaci network load time respons articl propos effici intrus detect method base cloud–edg collabor approach reduc comput workload speed model train prevent data privaci leakag enrich train data detect attack unknown local edg devic specif stack spars autoencod ssae first util data dimension reduct overcom bottleneck resourc constraint edg devic second consid longterm serial characterist iot traffic data tempor convolut network tcn model employ detect attack final cloud–edg collabor architectur base feder learn use coordin multiparti train intrus detect model fill gap miss detect intrus detect model due data silo experi show method reduc train time storag memori requir model train process 50 respect detect accuraci close central train model model train base cloud–edg collabor identifi attack unknown local edg devic,effici intrus detect toward iot network use cloud–edg collabor,effici intrus detect toward iot network use cloud–edg collabor internet thing iot increasingli util daili life industri product particularli critic infrastructur iot cybersecur effect peopl ’ safeti nation secur econom growth howev tradit cloudbas central intrus detect method satisfi demand data privaci network load time respons articl propos effici intrus detect method base cloud–edg collabor approach reduc comput workload speed model train prevent data privaci leakag enrich train data detect attack unknown local edg devic specif stack spars autoencod ssae first util data dimension reduct overcom bottleneck resourc constraint edg devic second consid longterm serial characterist iot traffic data tempor convolut network tcn model employ detect attack final cloud–edg collabor architectur base feder learn use coordin multiparti train intrus detect model fill gap miss detect intrus detect model due data silo experi show method reduc train time storag memori requir model train process 50 respect detect accuraci close central train model model train base cloud–edg collabor identifi attack unknown local edg devic
45,Implementing zero trust security with dual fuzzy methodology for trust-aware authentication and task offloading in Multi-access Edge Computing,"This paper proposes an efficient trust-aware authentication and task offloading scheme for Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) using the Zero Trust Security (ZTS) principles. The proposed method uses a dual fuzzy logic system to evaluate the trustworthiness of edge servers. Devices connected to the edge servers are authenticated using identity, biometrics and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) measures. After authentication, tasks can be offloaded from the devices to the most trustworthy edge server. The proposed scheme also considers the resource constraints of the edge servers and aims to minimise the overall task completion time. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes regarding authentication accuracy, task completion time, and energy consumption.","Belal Ali , Mark A.

46,"A practical framework for cyber defense generation, enforcement and evaluation","It is challenging to enforce and evaluate cyber-defenses for large networks. The current state-of-the-art approaches on defense enforcement and evaluations are manually performed by a security expert and they are executed separately without using a defined workflow. Moreover, the cyber defense generation, enforcement, and evaluation require costs, time, and effort of the security experts to effectively identify attacks and the best set of defenses to deploy. To effectively address these challenges, we propose a novel defense automation framework named CD-GEE (Cyber Defense Generation, Enforcement and Evaluation). CD-GEE can perform automated Cyber defense generation, defense enforcement and security evaluation without human intervention. CD-GEE works in the following five phases: (1) host/network data collection, (2) graphical security models construction, (3) cyber defense generation & selection, (4) defense deployment, and (5) defense evaluation and report. To show the usability and applicability of CD-GEE, we perform experiments on different networks including Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud. Besides, we also evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the defenses deployed via our proposed framework and tool. We show that the CD-GEE measures the security posture of the network before and after defense deployment and evaluation. We also showed that our proposed framework performed better than without the framework in enhancing the security of networks on both the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and simulation network environment.","Simon Yusuf Enoch , Chun Yong Moon , Donghwan Lee ,Myung Kil Ahn , Dong Seong Kim ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128622000810,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,challeng enforc evalu cyberdefens larg network current stateoftheart approach defens enforc evalu manual perform secur expert execut separ without use defin workflow moreov cyber defens gener enforc evalu requir cost time effort secur expert effect identifi attack best set defens deploy effect address challeng propos novel defens autom framework name cdgee cyber defens gener enforc evalu cdgee perform autom cyber defens gener defens enforc secur evalu without human intervent cdgee work follow five phase 1 hostnetwork data collect 2 graphic secur model construct 3 cyber defens gener select 4 defens deploy 5 defens evalu report show usabl applic cdgee perform experi differ network includ amazon ’ elast comput cloud besid also evalu perform effect defens deploy via propos framework tool show cdgee measur secur postur network defens deploy evalu also show propos framework perform better without framework enhanc secur network amazon elast comput cloud simul network environ,practic framework cyber defens gener enforc evalu,practic framework cyber defens gener enforc evalu challeng enforc evalu cyberdefens larg network current stateoftheart approach defens enforc evalu manual perform secur expert execut separ without use defin workflow moreov cyber defens gener enforc evalu requir cost time effort secur expert effect identifi attack best set defens deploy effect address challeng propos novel defens autom framework name cdgee cyber defens gener enforc evalu cdgee perform autom cyber defens gener defens enforc secur evalu without human intervent cdgee work follow five phase 1 hostnetwork data collect 2 graphic secur model construct 3 cyber defens gener select 4 defens deploy 5 defens evalu report show usabl applic cdgee perform experi differ network includ amazon ’ elast comput cloud besid also evalu perform effect defens deploy via propos framework tool show cdgee measur secur postur network defens deploy evalu also show propos framework perform better without framework enhanc secur network amazon elast comput cloud simul network environ
47,Designing and implementing an AUTOSAR-based Basic Software Module for enhanced security,"Electronic Control Units (ECUs) communicate with each other to accomplish the functionalities of modern vehicles. ECUs form an in-vehicle network that is precisely regulated and must be adequately protected from malicious activity, which has had several outbreaks in recent years. Therefore, we present CINNAMON, an AUTOSAR-based Basic Software Module that aims at confidentiality, integrity and authentication, all at the same time, for the traffic exchanged over the bus protocols that AUTOSAR supports. CINNAMON in fact stands for Confidential, INtegral aNd Authentic onboard coMmunicatiON.
This article introduces the requirements and specification of CINNAMON in a differential fashion with respect to the existing Secure Onboard Communication Basic Software Module, which does not include confidentiality. As a result, CINNAMON exceeds SecOC at least against information gathering attacks. The article then defines three security profiles, regulating also the freshness attribute appropriately. Most importantly, CINNAMON is not a simple academic exercise because it is implemented in a laboratory environment on commercial ECUs, thus reaching the level of TRL 4, “Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment”. The runtimes obtained on inexpensive devices are reassuring, paving the way for a possible large-scale application.","Giampaolo Bella , Pietro Biondi , Gianpiero Costantino , Ilaria Matteucci",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138912862200411X,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,electron control unit ecu commun accomplish function modern vehicl ecu form invehicl network precis regul must adequ protect malici activ sever outbreak recent year therefor present cinnamon autosarbas basic softwar modul aim confidenti integr authent time traffic exchang bu protocol autosar support cinnamon fact stand confidenti integr authent onboard commun articl introduc requir specif cinnamon differenti fashion respect exist secur onboard commun basic softwar modul includ confidenti result cinnamon exce secoc least inform gather attack articl defin three secur profil regul also fresh attribut appropri importantli cinnamon simpl academ exercis implement laboratori environ commerci ecu thu reach level trl 4 “ compon andor breadboard valid laboratori environ ” runtim obtain inexpens devic reassur pave way possibl largescal applic,design implement autosarbas basic softwar modul enhanc secur,design implement autosarbas basic softwar modul enhanc secur electron control unit ecu commun accomplish function modern vehicl ecu form invehicl network precis regul must adequ protect malici activ sever outbreak recent year therefor present cinnamon autosarbas basic softwar modul aim confidenti integr authent time traffic exchang bu protocol autosar support cinnamon fact stand confidenti integr authent onboard commun articl introduc requir specif cinnamon differenti fashion respect exist secur onboard commun basic softwar modul includ confidenti result cinnamon exce secoc least inform gather attack articl defin three secur profil regul also fresh attribut appropri importantli cinnamon simpl academ exercis implement laboratori environ commerci ecu thu reach level trl 4 “ compon andor breadboard valid laboratori environ ” runtim obtain inexpens devic reassur pave way possibl largescal applic
48,Game theoretic solution for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle network host under DDoS attack,"Game theory is being used in cybersecurity to observe different attacks as it can provide a mathematical representation of the interactions between system admins, hackers, and users. The game-theoretic solution determines the favorable parameters (strategies), predicts the player’s behavior, and suggests the best settings for minimizing the attack’s effect. To this end, our paper attempts to study the usefulness of game-theoretic applications for the prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on a drone by deriving the information from conventional game solutions and augmenting that with the bounded rationality concept called Quantal response equilibrium (QRE). In this process, we identify feasible strategies for each player through simulations and formulate five non-cooperative game scenarios for two variants of DDoS attacks. In these games, the traditional game-theoretic solution or Nash Equilibrium (NashE) provides information about the drone’s recommended settings, the hacker’s preferred strategy, and the game-theoretic threshold assuming that all participants are highly intelligent. We augment this information by considering the participant’s tendency to make errors and the evolution in their behavioral pattern from zero to high-values of rationality using QRE. The information coupled from NashE and QRE provides better clarity to a drone operator, thus improving the drone’s security by two levels and allowing the drone operator to take timely precautions. Inspired by this multilevel process, we propose an equivalent real-world framework for protecting Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) nodes against a DDoS attack.","Aakif Mairaj, Ahmad Y.

49,Evaluating Federated Learning for intrusion detection in Internet of Things: Review and challenges,"The application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to the well-known intrusion detection systems (IDS) is key to cope with increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks through an effective and efficient detection process. In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), most ML-enabled IDS approaches use centralized approaches where IoT devices share their data with data centers for further analysis. To mitigate privacy concerns associated with centralized approaches, in recent years the use of Federated Learning (FL) has attracted a significant interest in different sectors, including healthcare and transport systems. However, the development of FL-enabled IDS for IoT is in its infancy, and still requires research efforts from various areas, in order to identify the main challenges for the deployment in real-world scenarios. In this direction, our work evaluates a FL-enabled IDS approach based on a multiclass classifier considering different data distributions for the detection of different attacks in an IoT scenario. In particular, we use three different settings that are obtained by partitioning the recent ToN_IoT dataset according to IoT devices’ IP address and types of attack. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of different aggregation functions according to such setting by using the recent IBMFL framework as FL implementation. Additionally, we identify a set of challenges and future directions based on the existing literature and the analysis of our evaluation results.",Enrique Mármol CamposPablo Fernández Saura,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128621005405,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,applic machin learn ml techniqu wellknown intrus detect system id key cope increasingli sophist cybersecur attack effect effici detect process context internet thing iot mlenabl id approach use central approach iot devic share data data center analysi mitig privaci concern associ central approach recent year use feder learn fl attract signific interest differ sector includ healthcar transport system howev develop flenabl id iot infanc still requir research effort variou area order identifi main challeng deploy realworld scenario direct work evalu flenabl id approach base multiclass classifi consid differ data distribut detect differ attack iot scenario particular use three differ set obtain partit recent toniot dataset accord iot devic ’ ip address type attack furthermor evalu impact differ aggreg function accord set use recent ibmfl framework fl implement addit identifi set challeng futur direct base exist literatur analysi evalu result,evalu feder learn intrus detect internet thing review challeng,evalu feder learn intrus detect internet thing review challeng applic machin learn ml techniqu wellknown intrus detect system id key cope increasingli sophist cybersecur attack effect effici detect process context internet thing iot mlenabl id approach use central approach iot devic share data data center analysi mitig privaci concern associ central approach recent year use feder learn fl attract signific interest differ sector includ healthcar transport system howev develop flenabl id iot infanc still requir research effort variou area order identifi main challeng deploy realworld scenario direct work evalu flenabl id approach base multiclass classifi consid differ data distribut detect differ attack iot scenario particular use three differ set obtain partit recent toniot dataset accord iot devic ’ ip address type attack furthermor evalu impact differ aggreg function accord set use recent ibmfl framework fl implement addit identifi set challeng futur direct base exist literatur analysi evalu result
50,FedSBS: Federated-Learning participant-selection method for Intrusion Detection Systems,"Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach in which multiple participants collaboratively train a model. Participants keep data locally, train their local models, and aggregate them in a single global model in a federated server. Collaborative FL-based Intrusion Detection Systems face challenges on an uneven statistical distribution of data and malicious participants trying to subvert the learning process. The statistical hurdles associated with imbalanced data and malicious participants pose a risk of skewing the training with biased or random data. The inability to effectively manage these statistical inconsistencies may degrade system performance, leading to false intrusion detection or opening avenues for cybersecurity breaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a training method that employs score-based participant selection and utilizes global momentum for model aggregation. Our method improves the global model performance while mitigating the risks posed by malicious participants. The proposal incorporates a scoring system based on an information gain variant to evaluate each participant’s contribution. The scoring system and an epsilon greedy selection method ensure robust participant selection in each aggregation round. Furthermore, incorporating a global momentum term helps preserve previous knowledge at each aggregation round, contributing to model stability and overall learning. The proposed solution has demonstrated superior performance, delivering 80% F1-Score and 90% accuracy on experiments even in the presence of malicious participants, revealing the robustness and effectiveness of the proposal in mitigating statistical challenges. Consequently, the proposed method significantly enhances the performance of federated learning models, leading to more secure and efficient collaborative intrusion detection systems.",Helio N.

51,DACP: Enforcing a dynamic access control policy in cross-domain environments,"Enabling hybrid authorisations to enforce dynamic access control policy from single-domain to cross-domain environments (CDEs) is important for distributed services. However, traditional Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) models are incompatible with CDEs. To fill this gap, approaches that apply cryptographic primitives, e.g., attribute-based encryption (ABE), have been proposed. The computation and storage overhead in most ABE constructions is non-negligible and increases with the complexity of the associated policies. In addition, most access control policy systems enforce authorisation policies in a centralised way, raising serious security and privacy issues. In this paper, we introduce DACP – a practical Dynamic Access Control Policy system supporting dynamic cross-domain authorisation. DACP combines traditional ABAC approach and a novel cryptographic primitive Attribute-based group signature (ABGS). ABAC is used for the access control decision and policy enforcement according to the user’s attributes whereas ABGS is used for managing the user’s attributes between users and authorities. Thus, the user’s attributes are securely distributed along with the access structure in CDEs while preserving the user’s privacy. We present the concrete design and implementation of DACP, and evaluate it in real-world settings. The evaluation shows that DACP is practical and efficient in CDEs.","Ahmad Salehi S. , Runchao Han , Carsten Rudolph , Marthie Grobler ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128623004942,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,enabl hybrid authoris enforc dynam access control polici singledomain crossdomain environ cde import distribut servic howev tradit attributebas access control abac model incompat cde fill gap approach appli cryptograph primit eg attributebas encrypt abe propos comput storag overhead abe construct nonneglig increas complex associ polici addit access control polici system enforc authoris polici centralis way rais seriou secur privaci issu paper introduc dacp – practic dynam access control polici system support dynam crossdomain authoris dacp combin tradit abac approach novel cryptograph primit attributebas group signatur abg abac use access control decis polici enforc accord user ’ attribut wherea abg use manag user ’ attribut user author thu user ’ attribut secur distribut along access structur cde preserv user ’ privaci present concret design implement dacp evalu realworld set evalu show dacp practic effici cde,dacp enforc dynam access control polici crossdomain environ,dacp enforc dynam access control polici crossdomain environ enabl hybrid authoris enforc dynam access control polici singledomain crossdomain environ cde import distribut servic howev tradit attributebas access control abac model incompat cde fill gap approach appli cryptograph primit eg attributebas encrypt abe propos comput storag overhead abe construct nonneglig increas complex associ polici addit access control polici system enforc authoris polici centralis way rais seriou secur privaci issu paper introduc dacp – practic dynam access control polici system support dynam crossdomain authoris dacp combin tradit abac approach novel cryptograph primit attributebas group signatur abg abac use access control decis polici enforc accord user ’ attribut wherea abg use manag user ’ attribut user author thu user ’ attribut secur distribut along access structur cde preserv user ’ privaci present concret design implement dacp evalu realworld set evalu show dacp practic effici cde
52,Hierarchical feature block ranking for data-efficient intrusion detection modeling,"The intrusion detection field has been increasing the adoption of newer datasets after relying mainly on KDD99 and NSL-KDD. Both the height and the width of the newer datasets have increased substantially since they are geared towards evaluation by machine learning methods. The feature sets however are most often statistics, derived either from the packets, or more commonly from the (reconstructed) flows. The ease with which connected clusters of features can be extracted as well as the tendency to be overinclusive to provide researchers with as much data as possible has introduced significant bloat in the datasets. In order to improve the effective and efficient use of the datasets, this article proposes a hybrid feature selection mechanism based on a first-pass filter method and a second-pass embedded method with a central role for statistical testing to identify hierarchies of dominant feature sets. The non-destructive approach allows for the hierarchies to be inspected, interpreted and related to each other. The proposed approach is validated by constructing the feature hierarchies at three different resolutions for all recent datasets published by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (IDS2017, DoS2017, IDS2018 and DDoS2019, millions of samples, 76 features). Three standard supervised learners were given increasing access to the feature (blocks) in terms of their hierarchical position. The results show that attack classes with a clear network component can be detected with cross-validated balanced accuracy, precision and recall above 99%, even when the classification model has been built from just 1 to 4 features, while additionally under a very restrictive sampling regimen: training (0.8%), validation (0.2%) and testing (99%). When selecting models only for classification performance more attack classes are detected more reliably, and while this increases feature use to an average of 12, this is still preferable over using the datasets’ standard set of 76 features.","Laurens D’hooge, Miel Verkerken, Tim Wauters, Bruno Volckaert, Filip De Turck",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128621005107,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,intrus detect field increas adopt newer dataset reli mainli kdd99 nslkdd height width newer dataset increas substanti sinc gear toward evalu machin learn method featur set howev often statist deriv either packet commonli reconstruct flow eas connect cluster featur extract well tendenc overinclus provid research much data possibl introduc signific bloat dataset order improv effect effici use dataset articl propos hybrid featur select mechan base firstpass filter method secondpass embed method central role statist test identifi hierarchi domin featur set nondestruct approach allow hierarchi inspect interpret relat propos approach valid construct featur hierarchi three differ resolut recent dataset publish canadian institut cybersecur ids2017 dos2017 ids2018 ddos2019 million sampl 76 featur three standard supervis learner given increas access featur block term hierarch posit result show attack class clear network compon detect crossvalid balanc accuraci precis recal 99 even classif model built 1 4 featur addit restrict sampl regimen train 08 valid 02 test 99 select model classif perform attack class detect reliabl increas featur use averag 12 still prefer use dataset ’ standard set 76 featur,hierarch featur block rank dataeffici intrus detect model,hierarch featur block rank dataeffici intrus detect model intrus detect field increas adopt newer dataset reli mainli kdd99 nslkdd height width newer dataset increas substanti sinc gear toward evalu machin learn method featur set howev often statist deriv either packet commonli reconstruct flow eas connect cluster featur extract well tendenc overinclus provid research much data possibl introduc signific bloat dataset order improv effect effici use dataset articl propos hybrid featur select mechan base firstpass filter method secondpass embed method central role statist test identifi hierarchi domin featur set nondestruct approach allow hierarchi inspect interpret relat propos approach valid construct featur hierarchi three differ resolut recent dataset publish canadian institut cybersecur ids2017 dos2017 ids2018 ddos2019 million sampl 76 featur three standard supervis learner given increas access featur block term hierarch posit result show attack class clear network compon detect crossvalid balanc accuraci precis recal 99 even classif model built 1 4 featur addit restrict sampl regimen train 08 valid 02 test 99 select model classif perform attack class detect reliabl increas featur use averag 12 still prefer use dataset ’ standard set 76 featur
53,A survey on intrusion detection and prevention systems in digital substations,"Smart Grids integrate the traditional power grid with information processing and communication technologies. In particular, substation intelligent devices can now communicate with each other digitally to enable remote information gathering, monitoring, and control. There have been many efforts to promote global communication standards. The IEC–61850 international standard addresses substation communication networks and systems. Despite the many benefits, this standardized communication poses new cyber-security challenges. Also, traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) may not be suitable for digital substations, given their critical components and stringent time requirements. We present an in-depth analysis of attacks exploiting IEC–61850 substations and recent research efforts for detecting and preventing them. Our main contribution is an original taxonomy comprising design and evaluation aspects for substation-specific IDSs. This taxonomy includes IDS’s architectures, detection approaches, analysis, actions, data sources, detection range, validation strategies, and metrics. Additionally, we present a compilation of the detection rules deployed by the state-of-art IDSs and assess their resiliency to five types of attacks.

54,Swarm Intelligence inspired Intrusion Detection Systems — A systematic literature review,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the fundamental building blocks in securing a network. A huge number of techniques have been proposed and implemented to improve the performance and accuracy of intrusion detection models. In recent years, efforts have been made to keep the attack surface as small as possible. However, the attack vectors have evolved in terms of complexity and diversity, and various intelligent techniques have been employed by the adversaries to exploit the ecosystems. This exploitation can either make the whole system dysfunctional or may lead to important information leakage. More specifically, with the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT), more heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices are interconnecting with each other. These devices have limited processing power and resources, particularly for detecting intrusions. Consequently, Swarm Intelligence (SI) based techniques have received considerable attention, especially in the past decade, as the SI approaches have achieved a decent success rate by optimizing various aspects of an IDS. This paper presents a systematic review with a thorough coverage of articles published between 2010 and 2020 of the state-of-the-art swarm intelligence approaches deployed in various attack surfaces for intrusion detection in various domains. The paper also presents a categorization in accordance with applicability of these SI approaches in improving various aspects of an intrusion detection process. Moreover, the paper also discusses the capabilities and features of various datasets used in experimentation. This aims to help researchers in assessing the capabilities and limitations of SI algorithms to identify security threats and challenges to design and implement an IDS for the detection of cyber attacks in various domains. Moreover, this will also help security individuals in differentiating SI based IDS with traditional ones. As such, the survey would be equally beneficial for the researchers working in the domain of swarm intelligence as well as cybersecurity. The survey highlights certain existing challenges and provides directions to address them effectively. In addition, new research directions are also identified.","Muhammad Hassan Nasir , Salman A.

55,Censorship data-driven DNS resolution anomaly detection: An ensemble algorithm model with multivariate feature fusion,"The Domain Name System (DNS), as a critical component of Internet infrastructure, is crucial for maintaining network stability and security. However, vulnerabilities in the DNS resolution process make it susceptible to various network attacks. Current DNS resolution anomaly detection methods are challenged by the scarcity of diverse anomalous sample data and the difficulty in accurately capturing such anomalies. To address those challenges, we firstly introduce a proactive anomaly detection method based on bidirectional national censorship behavior, abbreviated as CB-BiDAM. This method can collect diverse anomalous resolution data from multiple network spaces, covering common types of resolution anomalies and effectively solving the problem of sample scarcity. Further, we extract multidimensional features from four key aspects: response content, DNS attributes, resolution paths, and timing, to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between multifaceted information in the DNS resolution process and anomalous events. Finally, based on these multidimensional features, we construct a DNS resolution anomaly detection model named DRADC, using a stacked ensemble approach. Through a series of comparative experiments, the DRADC model significantly outperforms existing machine learning algorithms in key metrics such as accuracy (97.48%), recall (96.87%), and F1 score (97.09%). Feature ablation experiments further demonstrates that incorporating multidimensional features significantly improves model performance, with a 3% increase in accuracy and a 3.5% increase in precision compared to models relying solely on response content features. By providing an accurate detection model for DNS resolution anomalies, this study aids network administrators in more effectively identifying and countering network attacks. Additionally, our research also contributes to the detection and response to domain censorship mechanisms, which is crucial for maintaining the openness and free flow of the Internet.","Chao Li, Yanan Cheng, Zhaoxin Zhang, ZunDong Zhang",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624005012,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,domain name system dn critic compon internet infrastructur crucial maintain network stabil secur howev vulner dn resolut process make suscept variou network attack current dn resolut anomali detect method challeng scarciti divers anomal sampl data difficulti accur captur anomali address challeng firstli introduc proactiv anomali detect method base bidirect nation censorship behavior abbrevi cbbidam method collect divers anomal resolut data multipl network space cover common type resolut anomali effect solv problem sampl scarciti extract multidimension featur four key aspect respons content dn attribut resolut path time gain deeper understand relationship multifacet inform dn resolut process anomal event final base multidimension featur construct dn resolut anomali detect model name dradc use stack ensembl approach seri compar experi dradc model significantli outperform exist machin learn algorithm key metric accuraci 9748 recal 9687 f1 score 9709 featur ablat experi demonstr incorpor multidimension featur significantli improv model perform 3 increas accuraci 35 increas precis compar model reli sole respons content featur provid accur detect model dn resolut anomali studi aid network administr effect identifi counter network attack addit research also contribut detect respons domain censorship mechan crucial maintain open free flow internet,censorship datadriven dn resolut anomali detect ensembl algorithm model multivari featur fusion,censorship datadriven dn resolut anomali detect ensembl algorithm model multivari featur fusion domain name system dn critic compon internet infrastructur crucial maintain network stabil secur howev vulner dn resolut process make suscept variou network attack current dn resolut anomali detect method challeng scarciti divers anomal sampl data difficulti accur captur anomali address challeng firstli introduc proactiv anomali detect method base bidirect nation censorship behavior abbrevi cbbidam method collect divers anomal resolut data multipl network space cover common type resolut anomali effect solv problem sampl scarciti extract multidimension featur four key aspect respons content dn attribut resolut path time gain deeper understand relationship multifacet inform dn resolut process anomal event final base multidimension featur construct dn resolut anomali detect model name dradc use stack ensembl approach seri compar experi dradc model significantli outperform exist machin learn algorithm key metric accuraci 9748 recal 9687 f1 score 9709 featur ablat experi demonstr incorpor multidimension featur significantli improv model perform 3 increas accuraci 35 increas precis compar model reli sole respons content featur provid accur detect model dn resolut anomali studi aid network administr effect identifi counter network attack addit research also contribut detect respons domain censorship mechan crucial maintain open free flow internet
56,Cross-domain network attack detection enabled by heterogeneous transfer learning,"In recent years, cybersecurity has been endlessly challenged by more and more sophisticated network attacks, due to lacking the ability to detect unknown attacks in time. Recent researches show that machine learning helps to improve the efficacy of network attack detection, by training network attack classification models with huge amount labeled data. However in internal networks, due to the scarcity of attack instances and lacking expert labor force to label the data, it is always difficult to obtain sufficient labeled data to train such models. To uncover unknown attacks with machine learning techniques in internal networks, we propose to exploit transfer learning to utilize public datasets that contains attack instances to train a prediction model that will be used for un-labeled internal datasets. The main problem is to address the heterogeneity between datasets. Specifically, we project two heterogeneous datasets into a common latent space and formulate an optimization problem to minimize the distance of two distributions in the common space. Then we apply MLP classifier to the projected data to identify attack instances in internal networks. We conduct experiments that perform transfer learning between the NSLKDD to UNSW-NB15 datasets. The results validate that the proposed method notably improves the cross-domain attack detection accuracy in learning scenarios, such as “DoS to DoS” and “R2L to Exploits”.","Chunrui Zhang , Gang Wang , Shen Wang , Dechen Zhan , Mingyong Yin ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128623001378,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,recent year cybersecur endlessli challeng sophist network attack due lack abil detect unknown attack time recent research show machin learn help improv efficaci network attack detect train network attack classif model huge amount label data howev intern network due scarciti attack instanc lack expert labor forc label data alway difficult obtain suffici label data train model uncov unknown attack machin learn techniqu intern network propos exploit transfer learn util public dataset contain attack instanc train predict model use unlabel intern dataset main problem address heterogen dataset specif project two heterogen dataset common latent space formul optim problem minim distanc two distribut common space appli mlp classifi project data identifi attack instanc intern network conduct experi perform transfer learn nslkdd unswnb15 dataset result valid propos method notabl improv crossdomain attack detect accuraci learn scenario “ do do ” “ r2l exploit ”,crossdomain network attack detect enabl heterogen transfer learn,crossdomain network attack detect enabl heterogen transfer learn recent year cybersecur endlessli challeng sophist network attack due lack abil detect unknown attack time recent research show machin learn help improv efficaci network attack detect train network attack classif model huge amount label data howev intern network due scarciti attack instanc lack expert labor forc label data alway difficult obtain suffici label data train model uncov unknown attack machin learn techniqu intern network propos exploit transfer learn util public dataset contain attack instanc train predict model use unlabel intern dataset main problem address heterogen dataset specif project two heterogen dataset common latent space formul optim problem minim distanc two distribut common space appli mlp classifi project data identifi attack instanc intern network conduct experi perform transfer learn nslkdd unswnb15 dataset result valid propos method notabl improv crossdomain attack detect accuraci learn scenario “ do do ” “ r2l exploit ”
57,Ransomware early detection: A survey,"In recent years, ransomware attacks have exploded globally, and it has become one of the most significant cyber threats to digital infrastructure. Such attacks have been targeting ranging from individuals to critical infrastructure or large organizations such as large commercial companies, energy facilities, medical centers and government departments. Ransomware attackers use sophisticated encryption techniques to hijack victims’ files in exchange for a large ransom to release encrypted data. Sophisticated encryption techniques make it almost impossible for victims to recover data without the secret key in the event of such an attack. To protect systems from ransomware threats, malicious activities had better be detected earlier, preferably before they engage in harmful behavior. Numerous studies have focused on ransomware threats and attempted to provide detection and prevention solutions for ransomware attacks, but none of the surveys explored the early detection of ransomware and highlighted challenges and issues with existing solutions. This survey fills this gap and provides a state-of-the-art overview of research on ransomware early detections. Moreover, we investigate the latest ransomware surveys and give an overview of the categories of ransomware from different perspectives, the evolution and attack process of ransomware, and provide datasets used for ransomware detection. Finally, the possible future research directions are discussed.","Mingcan Cen , Frank Jiang , Xingsheng Qin , Qinghong Jiang , Robin Doss",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128623005832,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,recent year ransomwar attack explod global becom one signific cyber threat digit infrastructur attack target rang individu critic infrastructur larg organ larg commerci compani energi facil medic center govern depart ransomwar attack use sophist encrypt techniqu hijack victim ’ file exchang larg ransom releas encrypt data sophist encrypt techniqu make almost imposs victim recov data without secret key event attack protect system ransomwar threat malici activ better detect earlier prefer engag harm behavior numer studi focus ransomwar threat attempt provid detect prevent solut ransomwar attack none survey explor earli detect ransomwar highlight challeng issu exist solut survey fill gap provid stateoftheart overview research ransomwar earli detect moreov investig latest ransomwar survey give overview categori ransomwar differ perspect evolut attack process ransomwar provid dataset use ransomwar detect final possibl futur research direct discuss,ransomwar earli detect survey,ransomwar earli detect survey recent year ransomwar attack explod global becom one signific cyber threat digit infrastructur attack target rang individu critic infrastructur larg organ larg commerci compani energi facil medic center govern depart ransomwar attack use sophist encrypt techniqu hijack victim ’ file exchang larg ransom releas encrypt data sophist encrypt techniqu make almost imposs victim recov data without secret key event attack protect system ransomwar threat malici activ better detect earlier prefer engag harm behavior numer studi focus ransomwar threat attempt provid detect prevent solut ransomwar attack none survey explor earli detect ransomwar highlight challeng issu exist solut survey fill gap provid stateoftheart overview research ransomwar earli detect moreov investig latest ransomwar survey give overview categori ransomwar differ perspect evolut attack process ransomwar provid dataset use ransomwar detect final possibl futur research direct discuss
58,LIO-IDS: Handling class imbalance using LSTM and improved one-vs-one technique in intrusion detection system,"Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are deployed in computer networks to identify intrusions. NIDSs analyse network traffic to detect malicious content generated from different types of cyber-attacks. Though NIDSs can classify frequent attacks correctly, their performance declines on infrequent network intrusions. This paper proposes LIO-IDS based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier and Improved One-vs-One technique for handling both frequent and infrequent network intrusions. LIO-IDS is a two-layer Anomaly-based NIDS (A-NIDS) that detects different network intrusions with high Accuracy and low computational time. Layer 1 of LIO-IDS identifies intrusions from normal network traffic by using the LSTM classifier. Layer 2 uses ensemble algorithms to classify the detected intrusions into different attack classes. This paper also proposes an Improved One-vs-One (I-OVO) technique for performing multi-class classification at the second layer of the proposed LIO-IDS. In contrast to the traditional OVO technique, the proposed I-OVO technique uses only three classifiers to test each sample, thereby reducing the testing time significantly. Also, oversampling techniques have been used at Layer 2 to enhance the detection ability of the proposed LIO-IDS. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in terms of Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, Receiver Characteristics Operating (ROC) curve, Area Under ROC (AUC) values, training time and testing time for the NSL-KDD, CIDDS-001, and CICIDS2017 datasets. The proposed LIO-IDS shows significant improvement in the results as compared to its counterparts. High attack detection rates and short computational times make the proposed LIO-IDS suitable to be deployed in the real-world for network-based intrusion detection.","Neha Gupta , Vinita Jindal , Punam Bedi",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128621001675,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,networkbas intrus detect system nidss deploy comput network identifi intrus nidss analys network traffic detect malici content gener differ type cyberattack though nidss classifi frequent attack correctli perform declin infrequ network intrus paper propos lioid base long shortterm memori lstm classifi improv onevson techniqu handl frequent infrequ network intrus lioid twolay anomalybas nid anid detect differ network intrus high accuraci low comput time layer 1 lioid identifi intrus normal network traffic use lstm classifi layer 2 use ensembl algorithm classifi detect intrus differ attack class paper also propos improv onevson iovo techniqu perform multiclass classif second layer propos lioid contrast tradit ovo techniqu propos iovo techniqu use three classifi test sampl therebi reduc test time significantli also oversampl techniqu use layer 2 enhanc detect abil propos lioid perform propos system evalu term accuraci recal precis f1score receiv characterist oper roc curv area roc auc valu train time test time nslkdd cidds001 cicids2017 dataset propos lioid show signific improv result compar counterpart high attack detect rate short comput time make propos lioid suitabl deploy realworld networkbas intrus detect,lioid handl class imbal use lstm improv onevson techniqu intrus detect system,lioid handl class imbal use lstm improv onevson techniqu intrus detect system networkbas intrus detect system nidss deploy comput network identifi intrus nidss analys network traffic detect malici content gener differ type cyberattack though nidss classifi frequent attack correctli perform declin infrequ network intrus paper propos lioid base long shortterm memori lstm classifi improv onevson techniqu handl frequent infrequ network intrus lioid twolay anomalybas nid anid detect differ network intrus high accuraci low comput time layer 1 lioid identifi intrus normal network traffic use lstm classifi layer 2 use ensembl algorithm classifi detect intrus differ attack class paper also propos improv onevson iovo techniqu perform multiclass classif second layer propos lioid contrast tradit ovo techniqu propos iovo techniqu use three classifi test sampl therebi reduc test time significantli also oversampl techniqu use layer 2 enhanc detect abil propos lioid perform propos system evalu term accuraci recal precis f1score receiv characterist oper roc curv area roc auc valu train time test time nslkdd cidds001 cicids2017 dataset propos lioid show signific improv result compar counterpart high attack detect rate short comput time make propos lioid suitabl deploy realworld networkbas intrus detect
59,A multi-node attack scheme based on community partitioning in large scale infrastructure networks,"Node attack plays a vital role in evaluating the reliability of large scale infrastructure networks, which has attracted intensive research interests. Unfortunately, most of them focus on single node attack. Multi-node attack based on MBA (Module based Adaptive) is a promising research vector with great potential in improving efficiency. However, MBA-based node attack typically needs to repetitively consider community structures of large networks during the entire node attack process, which brings significant loss in network reliability and causes computational overheads. In light of this, we propose a novel scheme based on MBA to implement multi-node attack, which adopts the Multilevel community partitioning algorithm to overcome the above limitations. We evaluate our scheme on two artificial synthetic networks and four real-world networks with comparison to four widely used node attack schemes, and demonstrate the non-negligible superiority of our scheme over all benchmarks. Especially in the US Powergrid, our scheme can always achieve robustness around 10 times that of other schemes when deleting the same percentage of nodes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve an MBA-based node attack scheme that only needs to execute the community partitioning algorithm once during the entire node deletion process.","Beibei Li, Wei Hu",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624002184,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,node attack play vital role evalu reliabl larg scale infrastructur network attract intens research interest unfortun focu singl node attack multinod attack base mba modul base adapt promis research vector great potenti improv effici howev mbabas node attack typic need repetit consid commun structur larg network entir node attack process bring signific loss network reliabl caus comput overhead light propos novel scheme base mba implement multinod attack adopt multilevel commun partit algorithm overcom limit evalu scheme two artifici synthet network four realworld network comparison four wide use node attack scheme demonstr nonneglig superior scheme benchmark especi us powergrid scheme alway achiev robust around 10 time scheme delet percentag node best knowledg first achiev mbabas node attack scheme need execut commun partit algorithm entir node delet process,multinod attack scheme base commun partit larg scale infrastructur network,multinod attack scheme base commun partit larg scale infrastructur network node attack play vital role evalu reliabl larg scale infrastructur network attract intens research interest unfortun focu singl node attack multinod attack base mba modul base adapt promis research vector great potenti improv effici howev mbabas node attack typic need repetit consid commun structur larg network entir node attack process bring signific loss network reliabl caus comput overhead light propos novel scheme base mba implement multinod attack adopt multilevel commun partit algorithm overcom limit evalu scheme two artifici synthet network four realworld network comparison four wide use node attack scheme demonstr nonneglig superior scheme benchmark especi us powergrid scheme alway achiev robust around 10 time scheme delet percentag node best knowledg first achiev mbabas node attack scheme need execut commun partit algorithm entir node delet process
60,ISPPFL: An incentive scheme based privacy-preserving federated learning for avatar in metaverse,"The metaverse, seen as the internet’s successor, is a digital world with its own values and economy, linked to the physical world. Accessed via digital avatars using VR equipment, it involves extensive personal data, raising concerns about data security and privacy. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning technique that ensures privacy by allowing metaverse avatars to share knowledge without revealing user data. However, recent research shows that federated learning still faces privacy threats, such as Source Inference Attacks (SIAs) in Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) and Label Inference Attacks (LIAs) in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose the first Incentive Scheme based Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for avatar in metaverse (ISPPFL). The framework is composed of a privacy risks auditor, perturbation generation mechanism and adaptive incentive mechanisms, which effectively defends against privacy risks. We conducted comprehensive experiments on two distinct datasets in various scenarios. The result demonstrated that, the ISPPFL can effectively defend against privacy attacks while maintain model accuracy. For SIAs under HFL, compared to the baseline, the introduction of perturbation and incentive mechanisms could minimize privacy risk indicator (PRI) to around 20%, while maintain the model performance. For LIAs under VFL, the PRI of the model with perturbation generation mechanisms could decrease by approximately 10% compared to the model trained without defenses. Simultaneously, with the introduction of adaptive incentive mechanisms, the PRI could drop from 90% to 69%. Ultimately, the paper also summarizes the completed work and proposes directions for future research.","Yang Bai , Gaojie Xing , Hongyan Wu , Zhihong Rao, Chengzong Peng , Yutang Rao , Wentao Yang , Chuan Ma , Jiani Li , Yimin Zhou",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624004869,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,metavers seen internet ’ successor digit world valu economi link physic world access via digit avatar use vr equip involv extens person data rais concern data secur privaci feder learn distribut machin learn techniqu ensur privaci allow metavers avatar share knowledg without reveal user data howev recent research show feder learn still face privaci threat sourc infer attack sia horizont feder learn hfl label infer attack lia vertic feder learn vfl solv problem paper propos first incent scheme base privacypreserv feder learn avatar metavers isppfl framework compos privaci risk auditor perturb gener mechan adapt incent mechan effect defend privaci risk conduct comprehens experi two distinct dataset variou scenario result demonstr isppfl effect defend privaci attack maintain model accuraci sia hfl compar baselin introduct perturb incent mechan could minim privaci risk indic pri around 20 maintain model perform lia vfl pri model perturb gener mechan could decreas approxim 10 compar model train without defens simultan introduct adapt incent mechan pri could drop 90 69 ultim paper also summar complet work propos direct futur research,isppfl incent scheme base privacypreserv feder learn avatar metavers,isppfl incent scheme base privacypreserv feder learn avatar metavers metavers seen internet ’ successor digit world valu economi link physic world access via digit avatar use vr equip involv extens person data rais concern data secur privaci feder learn distribut machin learn techniqu ensur privaci allow metavers avatar share knowledg without reveal user data howev recent research show feder learn still face privaci threat sourc infer attack sia horizont feder learn hfl label infer attack lia vertic feder learn vfl solv problem paper propos first incent scheme base privacypreserv feder learn avatar metavers isppfl framework compos privaci risk auditor perturb gener mechan adapt incent mechan effect defend privaci risk conduct comprehens experi two distinct dataset variou scenario result demonstr isppfl effect defend privaci attack maintain model accuraci sia hfl compar baselin introduct perturb incent mechan could minim privaci risk indic pri around 20 maintain model perform lia vfl pri model perturb gener mechan could decreas approxim 10 compar model train without defens simultan introduct adapt incent mechan pri could drop 90 69 ultim paper also summar complet work propos direct futur research
61,Optimal response to attacks on the open science grid,"Cybersecurity is a growing concern, especially in open grids, where attack propagation is easy because of prevalent collaborations among thousands of users and hundreds of institutions. The collaboration rules that typically govern large science experiments as well as social networks of scientists span across the institutional security boundaries. A common concern is that the increased openness may allow malicious attackers to spread more readily around the grid.
We consider how to optimally respond to attacks in open grid environments. To show how and why attacks spread more readily around the grid, we first discuss how collaborations manifest themselves in the grids and form the collaboration network graph, and how this collaboration network graph affects the security threat levels of grid participants. We present two mixed-integer program (MIP) models to find the optimal response to attacks in open grid environments, and also calculate the threat level associated with each grid participant. Given an attack scenario, our optimal response model aims to minimize the threat levels at unaffected participants while maximizing the uninterrupted scientific production (continuing collaborations). By adopting some of the collaboration rules (e.g., suspending a collaboration or shutting down a site), the model finds optimal response to subvert an attack scenario.","Mine Altunay , Sven Leyffer , Jeffrey T.

62,Network intrusion detection based on DNA spatial information,"There is an ever-increasing risk of illegal access-induced Network Intrusion (NI), which calls for prompt detection of illegal network behavior through profound Network Traffic (NT) analyses. However, current intrusion detection methods are limited in accuracy due to insufficient data standardization. This paper puts forward a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-Spatial Information (SI) method to overcome these limitations. A DNA encoding model is formed, which defines a mapping relationship between NT attributes and nucleobases to reconstruct NT samples expressed as DNA sequences. Then, a feature extraction algorithm is constructed that deduces a Spatial Information Feature Matrix (SIFM) to represent sequence statistical features. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm is adopted as a matching process to determine NI behaviors considering the detection efficiency. Following experiments evaluate its method performance on two datasets, NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. Results demonstrate that DNA-SI obtains better results than state-of-the-art works, where the accuracy, F1-score, recall, far are 95.75%, 94.41%, 94.12%, 3.26% and 92.30%, 92.78%, 89.82%, 4.66% respectively. The fact that it is insusceptible to minority intrusion samples is another point worth attention. In sum, this quick and accurate network intrusion detection points to a new orientation for safeguarding network security.","Tianhao Hou , Hongyan Xing , Xinyi Liang , Xin Su , Zenghui Wang",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128622003620,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,everincreas risk illeg accessinduc network intrus ni call prompt detect illeg network behavior profound network traffic nt analys howev current intrus detect method limit accuraci due insuffici data standard paper put forward deoxyribonucl acid dnaspati inform si method overcom limit dna encod model form defin map relationship nt attribut nucleobas reconstruct nt sampl express dna sequenc featur extract algorithm construct deduc spatial inform featur matrix sifm repres sequenc statist featur random forest rf algorithm adopt match process determin ni behavior consid detect effici follow experi evalu method perform two dataset nslkdd unswnb15 result demonstr dnasi obtain better result stateoftheart work accuraci f1score recal far 9575 9441 9412 326 9230 9278 8982 466 respect fact insuscept minor intrus sampl anoth point worth attent sum quick accur network intrus detect point new orient safeguard network secur,network intrus detect base dna spatial inform,network intrus detect base dna spatial inform everincreas risk illeg accessinduc network intrus ni call prompt detect illeg network behavior profound network traffic nt analys howev current intrus detect method limit accuraci due insuffici data standard paper put forward deoxyribonucl acid dnaspati inform si method overcom limit dna encod model form defin map relationship nt attribut nucleobas reconstruct nt sampl express dna sequenc featur extract algorithm construct deduc spatial inform featur matrix sifm repres sequenc statist featur random forest rf algorithm adopt match process determin ni behavior consid detect effici follow experi evalu method perform two dataset nslkdd unswnb15 result demonstr dnasi obtain better result stateoftheart work accuraci f1score recal far 9575 9441 9412 326 9230 9278 8982 466 respect fact insuscept minor intrus sampl anoth point worth attent sum quick accur network intrus detect point new orient safeguard network secur

This study proposes the Raiju framework, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven automation approach, which automatically implements steps of the post-exploitation phase for security-level evaluation. We implement two well-known RL algorithms, Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to evaluate specialized agents capable of making intelligent actions. With the support of Metasploit, modules corresponding to selected actions of the agent automatically launch real attacks of privileges escalation (PE), gathering hashdump (GH), and lateral movement (LM) on multiple platforms. Through leveraging RL, our objective is to empower agents that can autonomously select suitable actions to exploit vulnerabilities within target systems. This approach enables the automation of specific components within the penetration testing (PT) workflow, thereby enhancing its efficiency and adaptability to evolving threats and vulnerabilities. The experiments are performed in four real environments with agents trained in thousands of episodes. The agents can automatically launch exploits on the four environments and achieve a success ratio of over 84% across the three attack types. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the A2C algorithm in the realm of post-exploitation automation.","Van-Hau Pham, Hien Do Hoang, Phan Thanh Trung, Van Dinh Quoc, Trong-Nghia To, Phan The Duy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624005383,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,discov threat network system investig behavior attack success exploit import phase call postexploit although variou effici tool support postexploit implement crucial factor complet process remain experienc human expert known penetr tester pentest studi propos raiju framework reinforc learn rldriven autom approach automat implement step postexploit phase securitylevel evalu implement two wellknown rl algorithm advantag actor–crit a2c proxim polici optim ppo evalu special agent capabl make intellig action support metasploit modul correspond select action agent automat launch real attack privileg escal pe gather hashdump gh later movement lm multipl platform leverag rl object empow agent autonom select suitabl action exploit vulner within target system approach enabl autom specif compon within penetr test pt workflow therebi enhanc effici adapt evolv threat vulner experi perform four real environ agent train thousand episod agent automat launch exploit four environ achiev success ratio 84 across three attack type furthermor experi demonstr remark effect a2c algorithm realm postexploit autom,raiju reinforc learningguid postexploit autom secur assess network system,raiju reinforc learningguid postexploit autom secur assess network system discov threat network system investig behavior attack success exploit import phase call postexploit although variou effici tool support postexploit implement crucial factor complet process remain experienc human expert known penetr tester pentest studi propos raiju framework reinforc learn rldriven autom approach automat implement step postexploit phase securitylevel evalu implement two wellknown rl algorithm advantag actor–crit a2c proxim polici optim ppo evalu special agent capabl make intellig action support metasploit modul correspond select action agent automat launch real attack privileg escal pe gather hashdump gh later movement lm multipl platform leverag rl object empow agent autonom select suitabl action exploit vulner within target system approach enabl autom specif compon within penetr test pt workflow therebi enhanc effici adapt evolv threat vulner experi perform four real environ agent train thousand episod agent automat launch exploit four environ achiev success ratio 84 across three attack type furthermor experi demonstr remark effect a2c algorithm realm postexploit autom
64,Res-TranBiLSTM: An intelligent approach for intrusion detection in the Internet of Things,"The Internet of Things (IoT), as the information carrier of the Internet and telecommunications networks, is a new network technology comprising physical entities embedded with electronic components, software and sensors, and characterized by strong complexity and openness. With the massive amount of data, the occurrence of network intrusion is also increasingly frequent, involving industrial control systems, IoT devices, mobile security, cloud services, and telecommunications services. With the diversification and intelligence of cyberattack behaviors, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) face problems—such as insufficient feature extraction and inaccurate model classification—when faced with high-dimensional features and nonlinear massive data. Due to their powerful data representation learning ability, deep learning methods save substantial time in processing high-dimensional and complex intrusion data. On this basis, we propose an intrusion detection model using ResNet, Transformer and BiLSTM (Res-TranBiLSTM) that takes into account both the spatial and temporal features of network traffic. We use the Synthetic Minor Overriding Technique (SMOTE) – Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) method to alleviate the degree of data imbalance. In addition, we respectively establish a spatial feature extraction model based on ResNet and a temporal feature extraction model based on Transformer and BiLSTM to extract spatial features and temporal features parallelly. Finally, spatiotemporal features are included to achieve attack detection and classification. Further, simulation experiments are conducted using the public data sets NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017. The experiments are implemented using Python programming language and Pytorch framework. The results reveal that the performance of our proposed model is better than that of other models, with accuracy reaching 90.99%, 99.15% and 99.56%, on NSL-KDD dataset, CIC-IDS2017 dataset and MQTTset dataset, respectively. It increased the detection accuracy by about 1%-10% on NSL-KDD dataset and about 0.2%-10% on CIC-IDS2017 dataset, and about 1%-10% on MQTTset dataset. These results demonstrate that this method is effective in constructing and optimizing large-scale IDS in the IoT environment.","Shiyu Wang , Wenxiang Xu , Yiwen Liu",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128623004279,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,internet thing iot inform carrier internet telecommun network new network technolog compris physic entiti embed electron compon softwar sensor character strong complex open massiv amount data occurr network intrus also increasingli frequent involv industri control system iot devic mobil secur cloud servic telecommun servic diversif intellig cyberattack behavior tradit intrus detect system idss face problems—such insuffici featur extract inaccur model classification—when face highdimension featur nonlinear massiv data due power data represent learn abil deep learn method save substanti time process highdimension complex intrus data basi propos intrus detect model use resnet transform bilstm restranbilstm take account spatial tempor featur network traffic use synthet minor overrid techniqu smote – edit nearest neighbor enn method allevi degre data imbal addit respect establish spatial featur extract model base resnet tempor featur extract model base transform bilstm extract spatial featur tempor featur parallelli final spatiotempor featur includ achiev attack detect classif simul experi conduct use public data set nslkdd cicids2017 experi implement use python program languag pytorch framework result reveal perform propos model better model accuraci reach 9099 9915 9956 nslkdd dataset cicids2017 dataset mqttset dataset respect increas detect accuraci 110 nslkdd dataset 0210 cicids2017 dataset 110 mqttset dataset result demonstr method effect construct optim largescal id iot environ,restranbilstm intellig approach intrus detect internet thing,restranbilstm intellig approach intrus detect internet thing internet thing iot inform carrier internet telecommun network new network technolog compris physic entiti embed electron compon softwar sensor character strong complex open massiv amount data occurr network intrus also increasingli frequent involv industri control system iot devic mobil secur cloud servic telecommun servic diversif intellig cyberattack behavior tradit intrus detect system idss face problems—such insuffici featur extract inaccur model classification—when face highdimension featur nonlinear massiv data due power data represent learn abil deep learn method save substanti time process highdimension complex intrus data basi propos intrus detect model use resnet transform bilstm restranbilstm take account spatial tempor featur network traffic use synthet minor overrid techniqu smote – edit nearest neighbor enn method allevi degre data imbal addit respect establish spatial featur extract model base resnet tempor featur extract model base transform bilstm extract spatial featur tempor featur parallelli final spatiotempor featur includ achiev attack detect classif simul experi conduct use public data set nslkdd cicids2017 experi implement use python program languag pytorch framework result reveal perform propos model better model accuraci reach 9099 9915 9956 nslkdd dataset cicids2017 dataset mqttset dataset respect increas detect accuraci 110 nslkdd dataset 0210 cicids2017 dataset 110 mqttset dataset result demonstr method effect construct optim largescal id iot environ
65,An efficient SVM based DEHO classifier to detect DDoS attack in cloud computing environment,"Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is rising exponentially and creates a severe threat to security. Generally, the DDoS attack may appear uncomplicated but they are hard to prevent and considered as one of the most significant cybersecurity issues. Hence, addressing against DDoS attacks turns out to be imperative. The major goal of this paper involves the optimal detection of data samples as normal data samples and malicious/attacked data samples. This paper proposes a security algorithm against DDoS attacks by employing four significant phases namely the Database training phase, Data pre-processing phase, Feature selection phase and Classification phase. Initially, the data samples are to be trained before using it for attack detection. Later, the sample group is created for every file and the data samples are pre-processed in the data pre-processing phase. Secondly, in feature selection phase, the selected features are optimized by employing kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to obtain optimal features. Later, in the classification phase, a support vector machine-based discrete elephant herding optimization (SVM-DEHO) classifier is utilized to detect the data sample as normal data and attacked or malicious data. Finally, the proposed approach is examined for four different databases namely NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, ISCX ID and CIC-IDS2017 databases respectively. The experimental analyses are performed for various simulation metrics and the outcome reveals that the detection system performances are high using SVM-DEHO approach than other approaches.","Gowthul Alam MM , Jerald Nirmal Kumar S , Uma Mageswari R , Michael Raj TF",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128622002559,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,distribut denial servic ddo attack rise exponenti creat sever threat secur gener ddo attack may appear uncompl hard prevent consid one signific cybersecur issu henc address ddo attack turn imper major goal paper involv optim detect data sampl normal data sampl maliciousattack data sampl paper propos secur algorithm ddo attack employ four signific phase name databas train phase data preprocess phase featur select phase classif phase initi data sampl train use attack detect later sampl group creat everi file data sampl preprocess data preprocess phase secondli featur select phase select featur optim employ kernel princip compon analysi kpca obtain optim featur later classif phase support vector machinebas discret eleph herd optim svmdeho classifi util detect data sampl normal data attack malici data final propos approach examin four differ databas name nslkdd unswnb15 iscx id cicids2017 databas respect experiment analys perform variou simul metric outcom reveal detect system perform high use svmdeho approach approach,effici svm base deho classifi detect ddo attack cloud comput environ,effici svm base deho classifi detect ddo attack cloud comput environ distribut denial servic ddo attack rise exponenti creat sever threat secur gener ddo attack may appear uncompl hard prevent consid one signific cybersecur issu henc address ddo attack turn imper major goal paper involv optim detect data sampl normal data sampl maliciousattack data sampl paper propos secur algorithm ddo attack employ four signific phase name databas train phase data preprocess phase featur select phase classif phase initi data sampl train use attack detect later sampl group creat everi file data sampl preprocess data preprocess phase secondli featur select phase select featur optim employ kernel princip compon analysi kpca obtain optim featur later classif phase support vector machinebas discret eleph herd optim svmdeho classifi util detect data sampl normal data attack malici data final propos approach examin four differ databas name nslkdd unswnb15 iscx id cicids2017 databas respect experiment analys perform variou simul metric outcom reveal detect system perform high use svmdeho approach approach
66,Optimizing spectrum and energy efficiency in IRS-enabled UAV-ground communications,"As an essential prospective technology to fulfill the 6G ubiquitous connectivity, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has seen extensive adoption to provide demanding services in a variety of emergency rescue scenes and non-terrestrial network contexts. Due to the complex radio wave propagation environment and the on-board energy anxiety, high-performance and energy-efficient UAV-ground transmission has become a challenging issue to be addressed. While many research efforts have been dedicated to intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled UAV-ground communications, where the IRS is leveraged to adaptively adjust the electromagnetic characteristics of arrived signals to enhance the communication quality, the channel model considered is not consistent with the actual scenario. Besides, the dynamic trajectory for achievable data rate enhancement may not always be energy-efficient. Motivated by this, we consider both spectrum efficiency maximization and energy efficiency maximization for UAV-ground communications in the urban region with no direct line-of-sight transmission through designing the phase shift, user scheduling, and dynamic trajectory. To solve the two maximization problems, we propose the three-stage alternating optimization framework to find the corresponding optimal solutions via a series of mathematical derivation transformations. Finally, numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposal in improving spectrum and energy efficiency compared to other benchmarks.","Jingyi Li , Jiajia Liu , Jiadai Wang",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624007436,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,essenti prospect technolog fulfil 6g ubiquit connect unman aerial vehicl uav seen extens adopt provid demand servic varieti emerg rescu scene nonterrestri network context due complex radio wave propag environ onboard energi anxieti highperform energyeffici uavground transmiss becom challeng issu address mani research effort dedic intellig reflect surfac ir enabl uavground commun ir leverag adapt adjust electromagnet characterist arriv signal enhanc commun qualiti channel model consid consist actual scenario besid dynam trajectori achiev data rate enhanc may alway energyeffici motiv consid spectrum effici maxim energi effici maxim uavground commun urban region direct lineofsight transmiss design phase shift user schedul dynam trajectori solv two maxim problem propos threestag altern optim framework find correspond optim solut via seri mathemat deriv transform final numer result confirm effect propos improv spectrum energi effici compar benchmark,optim spectrum energi effici irsen uavground commun,optim spectrum energi effici irsen uavground commun essenti prospect technolog fulfil 6g ubiquit connect unman aerial vehicl uav seen extens adopt provid demand servic varieti emerg rescu scene nonterrestri network context due complex radio wave propag environ onboard energi anxieti highperform energyeffici uavground transmiss becom challeng issu address mani research effort dedic intellig reflect surfac ir enabl uavground commun ir leverag adapt adjust electromagnet characterist arriv signal enhanc commun qualiti channel model consid consist actual scenario besid dynam trajectori achiev data rate enhanc may alway energyeffici motiv consid spectrum effici maxim energi effici maxim uavground commun urban region direct lineofsight transmiss design phase shift user schedul dynam trajectori solv two maxim problem propos threestag altern optim framework find correspond optim solut via seri mathemat deriv transform final numer result confirm effect propos improv spectrum energi effici compar benchmark
67,ATT&CK-based Advanced Persistent Threat attacks risk propagation assessment model for zero trust networks,"In recent years, the growing frequency and intensity of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have significantly undermined the legitimacy and financial stability of government agencies, enterprises, and other entities. Moreover, these attacks have shown the inherent vulnerabilities in conventional border defense strategies. The emergence of the zero trust network architecture can be attributed to the increasing complexity of the cyber threat landscape. With the application of risk assessment, this paper effectively tackles the challenges posed by conventional network defense limitations and enhances the efficiency of the access control decision-making process. Nevertheless, the existing risk assessment approaches primarily focus on conventional security assessment objectives, which exhibits a deficiency in the ability to dynamically assess APT attacks. The Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) Framework introduced in this paper is a novel approach to mitigating APT attacks. This paper aims to mine and analyze the frequent item set and correlation of cyber threat penetration attack techniques. The paper also intends to construct an attack technique relationship diagram and develop a tactical prediction model for cyber threat penetration attacks using the Markov chain model. Finally, our study aims to establish a risk propagation model for APT threats based on the aforementioned model. The approach presented in this paper significantly enhances the capacity of zero trust networks in addressing sophisticated cyber threats.","Jingci Zhang , Jun Zheng , Zheng Zhang , Tian Chen , Yu-an Tan , Quanxin Zhang , Yuanzhang Li ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624002081,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,recent year grow frequenc intens advanc persist threat apt significantli undermin legitimaci financi stabil govern agenc enterpris entiti moreov attack shown inher vulner convent border defens strategi emerg zero trust network architectur attribut increas complex cyber threat landscap applic risk assess paper effect tackl challeng pose convent network defens limit enhanc effici access control decisionmak process nevertheless exist risk assess approach primarili focu convent secur assess object exhibit defici abil dynam assess apt attack adversari tactic techniqu common knowledg attck framework introduc paper novel approach mitig apt attack paper aim mine analyz frequent item set correl cyber threat penetr attack techniqu paper also intend construct attack techniqu relationship diagram develop tactic predict model cyber threat penetr attack use markov chain model final studi aim establish risk propag model apt threat base aforement model approach present paper significantli enhanc capac zero trust network address sophist cyber threat,attckbas advanc persist threat attack risk propag assess model zero trust network,attckbas advanc persist threat attack risk propag assess model zero trust network recent year grow frequenc intens advanc persist threat apt significantli undermin legitimaci financi stabil govern agenc enterpris entiti moreov attack shown inher vulner convent border defens strategi emerg zero trust network architectur attribut increas complex cyber threat landscap applic risk assess paper effect tackl challeng pose convent network defens limit enhanc effici access control decisionmak process nevertheless exist risk assess approach primarili focu convent secur assess object exhibit defici abil dynam assess apt attack adversari tactic techniqu common knowledg attck framework introduc paper novel approach mitig apt attack paper aim mine analyz frequent item set correl cyber threat penetr attack techniqu paper also intend construct attack techniqu relationship diagram develop tactic predict model cyber threat penetr attack use markov chain model final studi aim establish risk propag model apt threat base aforement model approach present paper significantli enhanc capac zero trust network address sophist cyber threat
68,Zoom-inRCL: Fine-grained Root Cause Localization for B5G/6G network slicing,"Network slicing, a cornerstone technology for the evolving B5G/6G, comprises the Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) layer, the network slice instance layer, the service instance layer and the management and orchestration module. Reflecting on the lessons from recent large-scale and enduring telecommunication disasters, which resulted in severe service degradation or even complete outages, we observe that many of these incidents stem from an initial simple malfunction within the NFVI layer. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the fine-grained Root Cause Localization (RCL) issue for B5G/6G network slicing deep into the NFVI layer, with our proposed Zoom-inRCL scheme capable of not only localizing the malfunctioning entity but also identifying the fault-related metrics. Specifically, it first utilizes the Deep Support Vector Data Description (DeepSVDD) algorithm to filter abnormal NF call graphs from NF invocation traces collected during periods of service degradation in slices, and then identifies suspicious faulty entities through a uniquely designed scoring method, and finally ranks metrics exclusively for those entities exhibiting high faulty scores. Performance evaluation conducted on a real-world mobile operator dataset demonstrates that Zoom-inRCL, by progressively filtering out unrelated noisy data, outperforms existing schemes in RCL accuracy while simultaneously maintaining low time costs. We believe our design idea can enhance the assurance of intelligent and effective operation in the future B5G/6G network slicing.","Yawen Tan , Jiajia Liu , Jiadai Wang",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624007254,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,network slice cornerston technolog evolv b5g6g compris network function virtual infrastructur nfvi layer network slice instanc layer servic instanc layer manag orchestr modul reflect lesson recent largescal endur telecommun disast result sever servic degrad even complet outag observ mani incid stem initi simpl malfunct within nfvi layer best knowledg first investig finegrain root caus local rcl issu b5g6g network slice deep nfvi layer propos zoominrcl scheme capabl local malfunct entiti also identifi faultrel metric specif first util deep support vector data descript deepsvdd algorithm filter abnorm nf call graph nf invoc trace collect period servic degrad slice identifi suspici faulti entiti uniqu design score method final rank metric exclus entiti exhibit high faulti score perform evalu conduct realworld mobil oper dataset demonstr zoominrcl progress filter unrel noisi data outperform exist scheme rcl accuraci simultan maintain low time cost believ design idea enhanc assur intellig effect oper futur b5g6g network slice,zoominrcl finegrain root caus local b5g6g network slice,zoominrcl finegrain root caus local b5g6g network slice network slice cornerston technolog evolv b5g6g compris network function virtual infrastructur nfvi layer network slice instanc layer servic instanc layer manag orchestr modul reflect lesson recent largescal endur telecommun disast result sever servic degrad even complet outag observ mani incid stem initi simpl malfunct within nfvi layer best knowledg first investig finegrain root caus local rcl issu b5g6g network slice deep nfvi layer propos zoominrcl scheme capabl local malfunct entiti also identifi faultrel metric specif first util deep support vector data descript deepsvdd algorithm filter abnorm nf call graph nf invoc trace collect period servic degrad slice identifi suspici faulti entiti uniqu design score method final rank metric exclus entiti exhibit high faulti score perform evalu conduct realworld mobil oper dataset demonstr zoominrcl progress filter unrel noisi data outperform exist scheme rcl accuraci simultan maintain low time cost believ design idea enhanc assur intellig effect oper futur b5g6g network slice
69,An evaluation of the performance of Restricted Boltzmann Machines as a model for anomaly network intrusion detection,"The continuous increase in the number of attacks on computer networks has raised serious concerns regarding the importance of establishing a methodology that can learn and adapt to new and novel attacks, such a model should be able to act or react to such threats within a timely manner, so that measures are undertaken to counter any potential breaches within the network. Training a model to distinguish between normal and anomalous network behavior is a difficult task due to the high dimensionality of the network traffic data. One of the key requirements of a successful Anomaly Network Intrusion Detection Systems (A-NIDS) is the ability to recognize new patterns of attacks that it has never before seen. This objective can be achieved through incorporating machine leaning techniques in the learning model of the A-NIDS. In this study, we demonstrate the use of a powerful machine learning technique called the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to distinguish between normal and anomalous NetFlow traffic. We evaluate our approach through testing it on the newly renowned Information Security Center of Excellence (ISCX) dataset. Our results indicate that RBMs can be trained successfully to classify normal and anomalous NetFlow traffic. Unlike previous studies, we employ measures of true positives and negatives along with the accuracy to test the effectiveness of RBM as a classifier for A-NIDS. We also utilize the usage of a balanced set to reduce any biases that appear during the RBM training.","Tamer Aldwairi , Dilina Perera , Mark A.

70,Cyber threat indicators extraction based on contextual knowledge prompt,"Extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOC) from security-related social data (e.g., security blogs, hacker forums) is crucial for predicting cyber risks and mitigating cyber attacks proactively. However, existing IOC extraction approaches suffer from two serious limitations. First, they fail to learn the multiculti-granular and fine-grained IOC features, resulting in high false positives. Second, current methods cannot incorporate symbolic rules and contextual knowledge, resulting in poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose AIIOC, an Accurate and Interpretable I O C extraction model based on contextual knowledge prompts. Particularly, AIIOC first proposes a multi-granularity attention mechanism to learn fine-grained IOC features and boost the accuracy of IOC identification. Additionally, AIIOC designs a novel sequence labeling method that integrates symbolic rules and contextual knowledge prompts, which can encode symbolic rules and contextual semantics of IOC in trainable recurrent neural networks to improve both accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify that AIIOC outperforms state-of-the-art methods and showcases promising interpretability by incorporating symbolic rules and contextual knowledge prompts.","Hailiang Tang , Dawei Lin , Wanyu Li , Wenxiao Zhang , Jun Zhao ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624006716,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,extract indic compromis ioc securityrel social data eg secur blog hacker forum crucial predict cyber risk mitig cyber attack proactiv howev exist ioc extract approach suffer two seriou limit first fail learn multicultigranular finegrain ioc featur result high fals posit second current method incorpor symbol rule contextu knowledg result poor interpret paper propos aiioc accur interpret c extract model base contextu knowledg prompt particularli aiioc first propos multigranular attent mechan learn finegrain ioc featur boost accuraci ioc identif addit aiioc design novel sequenc label method integr symbol rule contextu knowledg prompt encod symbol rule contextu semant ioc trainabl recurr neural network improv accuraci interpret experiment result two realworld dataset verifi aiioc outperform stateoftheart method showcas promis interpret incorpor symbol rule contextu knowledg prompt,cyber threat indic extract base contextu knowledg prompt,cyber threat indic extract base contextu knowledg prompt extract indic compromis ioc securityrel social data eg secur blog hacker forum crucial predict cyber risk mitig cyber attack proactiv howev exist ioc extract approach suffer two seriou limit first fail learn multicultigranular finegrain ioc featur result high fals posit second current method incorpor symbol rule contextu knowledg result poor interpret paper propos aiioc accur interpret c extract model base contextu knowledg prompt particularli aiioc first propos multigranular attent mechan learn finegrain ioc featur boost accuraci ioc identif addit aiioc design novel sequenc label method integr symbol rule contextu knowledg prompt encod symbol rule contextu semant ioc trainabl recurr neural network improv accuraci interpret experiment result two realworld dataset verifi aiioc outperform stateoftheart method showcas promis interpret incorpor symbol rule contextu knowledg prompt

72,Analyzing the influence of the sampling rate in the detection of malicious traffic on flow data,"Cyberattacks are a growing concern for companies and public administrations. The literature shows that analyzing network-layer traffic can detect intrusion attempts. However, such detection usually implies studying every datagram in a computer network. Therefore, routers routing a significant volume of network traffic do not perform an in-depth analysis of every packet. Instead, they analyze traffic patterns based on network flows. However, even gathering and analyzing flow data has a high-computational cost, and therefore routers usually apply a sampling rate to generate flow data. Adjusting the sampling rate is a tricky problem. If the sampling rate is low, much information is lost and some cyberattacks may be neglected, but if the sampling rate is high, routers cannot deal with it. This paper tries to characterize the influence of this parameter in different detection methods based on machine learning. To do so, we trained and tested malicious-traffic detection models using synthetic flow data gathered with several sampling rates. Then, we double-check the above models with flow data from the public BoT-IoT dataset and with actual flow data collected on RedCAYLE, the Castilla y León regional academic network.","Adrián Campazas-Vega , Ignacio Samuel Crespo-Martínez ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128623003961,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,cyberattack grow concern compani public administr literatur show analyz networklay traffic detect intrus attempt howev detect usual impli studi everi datagram comput network therefor router rout signific volum network traffic perform indepth analysi everi packet instead analyz traffic pattern base network flow howev even gather analyz flow data highcomput cost therefor router usual appli sampl rate gener flow data adjust sampl rate tricki problem sampl rate low much inform lost cyberattack may neglect sampl rate high router deal paper tri character influenc paramet differ detect method base machin learn train test malicioustraff detect model use synthet flow data gather sever sampl rate doublecheck model flow data public botiot dataset actual flow data collect redcayl castilla león region academ network,analyz influenc sampl rate detect malici traffic flow data,analyz influenc sampl rate detect malici traffic flow data cyberattack grow concern compani public administr literatur show analyz networklay traffic detect intrus attempt howev detect usual impli studi everi datagram comput network therefor router rout signific volum network traffic perform indepth analysi everi packet instead analyz traffic pattern base network flow howev even gather analyz flow data highcomput cost therefor router usual appli sampl rate gener flow data adjust sampl rate tricki problem sampl rate low much inform lost cyberattack may neglect sampl rate high router deal paper tri character influenc paramet differ detect method base machin learn train test malicioustraff detect model use synthet flow data gather sever sampl rate doublecheck model flow data public botiot dataset actual flow data collect redcayl castilla león region academ network
73,Enhancing privacy and security in 5G networks with an anonymous handover protocol based on Blockchain and Zero Knowledge Proof,"The latest advancement in cellular technology, 5G, has the ability to facilitate various applications such as Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, vehicular communications, and the Internet of Everything (IoE). However, the technology is faced with challenges related to user privacy, resource management, handover authentication, and security of the air interface and internet channels. Moreover, the use of specialized base stations such as wireless Access Points (AP) and Road-Side Units (RSU) in vehicular communications may be owned by subscribers outside formal network operators. The conventional handover authentication schemes have a lengthy latency period that conflicts with the 5G quality of service. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents an anonymous scheme that utilizes Blockchain and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to ensure efficient privacy in the handover protocol of 5G Networks. The proposed scheme has been thoroughly evaluated for security and privacy and has shown to be resistant to identity catching, location area tracing, and replay attacks while achieving Forward/Backward secrecy. Furthermore, the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme indicates that it is efficient and speedy as it involves a limited number of messages, low computation, and does not necessitate the involvement of the Home Network (HN) in the authentication or handover protocols.

74,TLS-handshake for Plug and Charge in vehicular communications,"Electric vehicle technology has brought some important issues to order. Securing the communication between electric vehicle and charging station is an important one. The International Organization for Standardization released ISO 15118 standard to specify the communication between electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment. The ISO 15118 standard requires Transport Layer Security function for secure charging communication between electric vehicle and charging station as mandatory. The Transport Layer Security requirements have been completely changed with the latest version of the standard (ISO 15118-20) and have not been clearly described and implemented yet. The implementation of the function causes an inevitable vulnerability due to non-functioning authentication resulting with the entire vehicle function and security system can suddenly stop working. For this reason, new Transport Layer Security protocol must urgently be analyzed, developed, integrated, and implemented.
This study proposes solutions for the development, implementation, realization of Transport Layer Security handshake requirements and functions between electric vehicle and charging station with ISO 15118 protocol. The new and existing Transport Layer Security requirements, analyzed, evaluated and the new Transport Layer Security functions derived and fully described. Based on these requirements and functions, a Transport Layer Security communication sequence and processes are developed and implemented and validated on the test bench. The validation proved sufficient implementation of the Transport Layer Security functions (successful authentication, exchange of cipher suite parameters and generation of the TLS master key). The messages were prosperous encrypted and decrypted with the generated master key. Thus, Transport Layer Security handshake is developed, implemented, and validated with this study.","Ahmet Kilic

75,Authentication of underwater assets,"Secure digital wireless communication in the acoustic domain has become a key issue as underwater operations shift towards employing a heterogeneous mix of robotic assets and as the security of digital systems becomes challenged across all domains. At the same time, a proliferation of underwater signal coding and physical layer options are delivering greater bandwidth and flexibility, but mostly without the standards necessary for interoperability. We address here an essential requirement for security, namely a confirmation of asset identities also known as authentication. We propose, implement, verify and validate an authentication protocol based on the first digital underwater communications standard. Our scheme is applicable primarily to AUVs operating around offshore oil and gas facilities, but also to other underwater devices that may in the future have acoustic modems. It makes communication including command and control significantly more secure, and provides a foundation for the development of more sophisticated security mechanisms.","Bálint Z.

76,Collaborative credentials for the Internet of Things,"The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) paradigm has emerged as a decentralized Identity Management model with interesting capabilities for the Internet of Things (IoT). However, current standard SSI protocols and procedures only consider that individuals store their own identity, failing to provide an accurate solution for the identity management of groups where participants might use credentials from different identities and collaborate to meet a set of verifier´s requirements. The present work introduces the concept of Collaborative Credentials (CCs) to formalize identity management procedures that model the collaboration within a group of participants. CCs allow to leverage use cases requiring collaboration that cannot be solved with standard SSI verifiable credentials, increase the privacy of group participants and enable the development of a software framework that any verifier/holder could use to generate a generic application. In the paper, a generic model for CCs is presented, together with an implementation example that is subsequently evaluated in an experimental testbed.","Santiago de Diego , Cristina Regueiro , Gabriel Maciá-Fernández",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624004614,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,selfsovereign ident ssi paradigm emerg decentr ident manag model interest capabl internet thing iot howev current standard ssi protocol procedur consid individu store ident fail provid accur solut ident manag group particip might use credenti differ ident collabor meet set verifier´ requir present work introduc concept collabor credenti cc formal ident manag procedur model collabor within group particip cc allow leverag use case requir collabor solv standard ssi verifi credenti increas privaci group particip enabl develop softwar framework verifierhold could use gener gener applic paper gener model cc present togeth implement exampl subsequ evalu experiment testb,collabor credenti internet thing,collabor credenti internet thing selfsovereign ident ssi paradigm emerg decentr ident manag model interest capabl internet thing iot howev current standard ssi protocol procedur consid individu store ident fail provid accur solut ident manag group particip might use credenti differ ident collabor meet set verifier´ requir present work introduc concept collabor credenti cc formal ident manag procedur model collabor within group particip cc allow leverag use case requir collabor solv standard ssi verifi credenti increas privaci group particip enabl develop softwar framework verifierhold could use gener gener applic paper gener model cc present togeth implement exampl subsequ evalu experiment testb
77,Introducing packet-level analysis in programmable data planes to advance Network Intrusion Detection,"Programmable data planes offer precise control over the low-level processing steps applied to network packets, serving as a valuable tool for analysing malicious flows in the field of intrusion detection. Albeit with limitations on physical resources and capabilities, they allow for the efficient extraction of detailed traffic information, which can then be utilised by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms responsible for identifying security threats. In addressing resource constraints, existing solutions in the literature rely on compressing network data through the collection of statistical traffic features in the data plane. While this compression saves memory resources in switches and minimises the burden on the control channel between the data and the control plane, it also results in a loss of information available to the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), limiting access to packet payload, categorical features, and the semantic understanding of network communications, such as the behaviour of packets within traffic flows. This paper proposes P4DDLe, a framework that exploits the flexibility of P4-based programmable data planes for packet-level feature extraction and pre-processing. P4DDLe leverages the programmable data plane to extract raw packet features from the network traffic, categorical features included, and to organise them in a way that the semantics of traffic flows are preserved. To minimise memory and control channel overheads, P4DDLe selectively processes and filters packet-level data, so that only the features required by the NIDS are collected. The experimental evaluation with recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack data demonstrates that the proposed approach is very efficient in collecting compact and high-quality representations of network flows, ensuring precise detection of DDoS attacks.","Roberto Doriguzzi-Corin , Luis Augusto Dias Knob , Luca Mendozzi ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128623006072,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,programm data plane offer precis control lowlevel process step appli network packet serv valuabl tool analys malici flow field intrus detect albeit limit physic resourc capabl allow effici extract detail traffic inform utilis machin learn ml algorithm respons identifi secur threat address resourc constraint exist solut literatur reli compress network data collect statist traffic featur data plane compress save memori resourc switch minimis burden control channel data control plane also result loss inform avail network intrus detect system nid limit access packet payload categor featur semant understand network commun behaviour packet within traffic flow paper propos p4ddle framework exploit flexibl p4base programm data plane packetlevel featur extract preprocess p4ddle leverag programm data plane extract raw packet featur network traffic categor featur includ organis way semant traffic flow preserv minimis memori control channel overhead p4ddle select process filter packetlevel data featur requir nid collect experiment evalu recent distribut denial servic ddo attack data demonstr propos approach effici collect compact highqual represent network flow ensur precis detect ddo attack,introduc packetlevel analysi programm data plane advanc network intrus detect,introduc packetlevel analysi programm data plane advanc network intrus detect programm data plane offer precis control lowlevel process step appli network packet serv valuabl tool analys malici flow field intrus detect albeit limit physic resourc capabl allow effici extract detail traffic inform utilis machin learn ml algorithm respons identifi secur threat address resourc constraint exist solut literatur reli compress network data collect statist traffic featur data plane compress save memori resourc switch minimis burden control channel data control plane also result loss inform avail network intrus detect system nid limit access packet payload categor featur semant understand network commun behaviour packet within traffic flow paper propos p4ddle framework exploit flexibl p4base programm data plane packetlevel featur extract preprocess p4ddle leverag programm data plane extract raw packet featur network traffic categor featur includ organis way semant traffic flow preserv minimis memori control channel overhead p4ddle select process filter packetlevel data featur requir nid collect experiment evalu recent distribut denial servic ddo attack data demonstr propos approach effici collect compact highqual represent network flow ensur precis detect ddo attack
78,Phishing URL detection generalisation using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Phishing attacks are a prevailing problem in cybersecurity. In many data breaches, the initial entry can be traced back to phishing. URL-based phishing detection is one of the many ways of phishing attempt detection where solely the properties of the URLs are used to decide whether a given URL is phishing or not. While there are multiple existing works that use machine learning and deep learning to detect phishing URLs, in this paper, we show that such methods lack generalisation (i.e., they work effectively only when the test sets are split from the same training dataset). This is a significant issue since the vast majority of phishing attempts are short-lived and use freshly created domain names. Also, many network vantage points and middleboxes record URLs in slightly different formats and as such, URL data collected at various companies may be different. To address this, we propose an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation-based framework to increase the model transferability between datasets. We evaluate our approach using three datasets and show that the increase in cross-dataset F1 score performance is 0.06 on average and in some cases approximately as high as 0.2.","Fariza Rashid , Ben Doyle , Soyeon Caren Han , Suranga Seneviratne",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624002305,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,phish attack prevail problem cybersecur mani data breach initi entri trace back phish urlbas phish detect one mani way phish attempt detect sole properti url use decid whether given url phish multipl exist work use machin learn deep learn detect phish url paper show method lack generalis ie work effect test set split train dataset signific issu sinc vast major phish attempt shortliv use freshli creat domain name also mani network vantag point middlebox record url slightli differ format url data collect variou compani may differ address propos unsupervis domain adaptationbas framework increas model transfer dataset evalu approach use three dataset show increas crossdataset f1 score perform 006 averag case approxim high 02,phish url detect generalis use unsupervis domain adapt,phish url detect generalis use unsupervis domain adapt phish attack prevail problem cybersecur mani data breach initi entri trace back phish urlbas phish detect one mani way phish attempt detect sole properti url use decid whether given url phish multipl exist work use machin learn deep learn detect phish url paper show method lack generalis ie work effect test set split train dataset signific issu sinc vast major phish attempt shortliv use freshli creat domain name also mani network vantag point middlebox record url slightli differ format url data collect variou compani may differ address propos unsupervis domain adaptationbas framework increas model transfer dataset evalu approach use three dataset show increas crossdataset f1 score perform 006 averag case approxim high 02
79,A comprehensive survey on digital twin for future networks and emerging Internet of Things industry,"The rapid growth of industrial digitalization in the Industry 4.0 era is fundamentally transforming the industrial sector by connecting products, machines, and people, offering real-time digital models to allow self-diagnosis, self-optimization and self-configuration. However, this uptake in such a digital transformation faces numerous obstacles. For example, the lack of real-time data feeds to perform custom closed-loop control and realize common, powerful industrial systems, the complexity of traditional tools and their inability in finding effective solutions to industry problems, lack of capabilities to experiment rapidly on innovative ideas, and the absence of continuous real-time interactions between physical objects and their simulation representations along with reliable two-way communications, are key barriers towards the adoption of such a digital transformation. Digital twins hold the promise of improving maintainability and deployability, enabling flexibility, auditability, and responsiveness to changing conditions, allowing continuous learning, monitoring and actuation, and allowing easy integration of new technologies in order to deploy open, scalable and reliable Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
A critical understanding of this emerging paradigm is necessary to address the multiple dimensions of challenges in realizing digital twins at scale and create new means to generate knowledge in the industrial IoT. To address these requirements, this paper surveys existing digital twin along software technologies, standardization efforts and the wide range of recent and state-of-the-art digital twin-based projects; presents diverse use cases that can benefit from this emerging technology; followed by an in-depth discussion of the major challenges in this area drawing upon the research status and key trends in Digital Twins.","Akram Hakiri , Aniruddha Gokhale , Sadok Ben Yahia , Nedra Mellouli",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128624001828,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,rapid growth industri digit industri 40 era fundament transform industri sector connect product machin peopl offer realtim digit model allow selfdiagnosi selfoptim selfconfigur howev uptak digit transform face numer obstacl exampl lack realtim data feed perform custom closedloop control realiz common power industri system complex tradit tool inabl find effect solut industri problem lack capabl experi rapidli innov idea absenc continu realtim interact physic object simul represent along reliabl twoway commun key barrier toward adopt digit transform digit twin hold promis improv maintain deploy enabl flexibl audit respons chang condit allow continu learn monitor actuat allow easi integr new technolog order deploy open scalabl reliabl industri internet thing iiot critic understand emerg paradigm necessari address multipl dimens challeng realiz digit twin scale creat new mean gener knowledg industri iot address requir paper survey exist digit twin along softwar technolog standard effort wide rang recent stateoftheart digit twinbas project present divers use case benefit emerg technolog follow indepth discuss major challeng area draw upon research statu key trend digit twin,comprehens survey digit twin futur network emerg internet thing industri,comprehens survey digit twin futur network emerg internet thing industri rapid growth industri digit industri 40 era fundament transform industri sector connect product machin peopl offer realtim digit model allow selfdiagnosi selfoptim selfconfigur howev uptak digit transform face numer obstacl exampl lack realtim data feed perform custom closedloop control realiz common power industri system complex tradit tool inabl find effect solut industri problem lack capabl experi rapidli innov idea absenc continu realtim interact physic object simul represent along reliabl twoway commun key barrier toward adopt digit transform digit twin hold promis improv maintain deploy enabl flexibl audit respons chang condit allow continu learn monitor actuat allow easi integr new technolog order deploy open scalabl reliabl industri internet thing iiot critic understand emerg paradigm necessari address multipl dimens challeng realiz digit twin scale creat new mean gener knowledg industri iot address requir paper survey exist digit twin along softwar technolog standard effort wide rang recent stateoftheart digit twinbas project present divers use case benefit emerg technolog follow indepth discuss major challeng area draw upon research statu key trend digit twin
80,Fog-cloud based intrusion detection system using Recurrent Neural Networks and feature selection for IoT networks,"Deep learning (DL) techniques are being widely researched for their effectiveness in detecting cyber intrusions against the Internet of Things (IoT). Time sensitive Critical Infrastructures (CIs) that rely on IoT require rapid detection of cyber intrusions close to the constrained devices in order to prevent service delays. Deep learning techniques perform better in detecting attacks compared to shallow machine learning algorithms and can be used for intrusion detection. However, communication overheads due to large volume of IoT data and computation requirements for deep learning models prevents effective application of deep learning models closer to the constrained devices. Existing IDS techniques are either based on shallow learning algorithms or not trained on relevant IoT datasets and furthermore not designed for distributed fog-cloud deployment. To counter these issues, we propose a novel fog-cloud based IoT intrusion detection framework which incorporates a distributed processing by splitting the dataset according to attack class and a feature selection step on time-series IoT data. This is followed by a deep learning Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) for attack detection. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated using the high-dimensional BoT-IoT dataset which contains large volumes of realistic IoT attack traffic. Results show that feature selection methods significantly reduced the dataset size by 90% under the computation requirements without compromising on the attack detection ability. The models built on reduced dataset achieved higher recall rate compared to models trained on full feature set without loosing class differentiation ability. The SimpleRNN and Bi-LSTM models also did not suffer any underfitting or overfitting with the reduced feature space. The proposed deep learning based IoT intrusion detection framework is suitable for fog-cloud based deployment and can scale well even with large volumes of IoT data.","Naeem Firdous Syed , Mengmeng Ge , Zubair Baig ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138912862300107X,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,deep learn dl techniqu wide research effect detect cyber intrus internet thing iot time sensit critic infrastructur ci reli iot requir rapid detect cyber intrus close constrain devic order prevent servic delay deep learn techniqu perform better detect attack compar shallow machin learn algorithm use intrus detect howev commun overhead due larg volum iot data comput requir deep learn model prevent effect applic deep learn model closer constrain devic exist id techniqu either base shallow learn algorithm train relev iot dataset furthermor design distribut fogcloud deploy counter issu propos novel fogcloud base iot intrus detect framework incorpor distribut process split dataset accord attack class featur select step timeseri iot data follow deep learn recurr neural network simplernn bidirect long shortterm memori lstm attack detect effect propos approach evalu use highdimension botiot dataset contain larg volum realist iot attack traffic result show featur select method significantli reduc dataset size 90 comput requir without compromis attack detect abil model built reduc dataset achiev higher recal rate compar model train full featur set without loos class differenti abil simplernn bilstm model also suffer underfit overfit reduc featur space propos deep learn base iot intrus detect framework suitabl fogcloud base deploy scale well even larg volum iot data,fogcloud base intrus detect system use recurr neural network featur select iot network,fogcloud base intrus detect system use recurr neural network featur select iot network deep learn dl techniqu wide research effect detect cyber intrus internet thing iot time sensit critic infrastructur ci reli iot requir rapid detect cyber intrus close constrain devic order prevent servic delay deep learn techniqu perform better detect attack compar shallow machin learn algorithm use intrus detect howev commun overhead due larg volum iot data comput requir deep learn model prevent effect applic deep learn model closer constrain devic exist id techniqu either base shallow learn algorithm train relev iot dataset furthermor design distribut fogcloud deploy counter issu propos novel fogcloud base iot intrus detect framework incorpor distribut process split dataset accord attack class featur select step timeseri iot data follow deep learn recurr neural network simplernn bidirect long shortterm memori lstm attack detect effect propos approach evalu use highdimension botiot dataset contain larg volum realist iot attack traffic result show featur select method significantli reduc dataset size 90 comput requir without compromis attack detect abil model built reduc dataset achiev higher recal rate compar model train full featur set without loos class differenti abil simplernn bilstm model also suffer underfit overfit reduc featur space propos deep learn base iot intrus detect framework suitabl fogcloud base deploy scale well even larg volum iot data
81,PhishNot: A Cloud-Based Machine-Learning Approach to Phishing URL Detection,"Phishing is constantly growing to be one of the most adopted tools for conducting cyber-attacks. Recent statistics indicated that 97% of users could not recognize a sophisticated phishing email. With over 1.5 million new phishing websites being created every month, legacy black lists and rule-based filters can no longer mitigate the increasing risks and sophistication level of phishing. Phishing can deploy various malicious payloads that compromise the network’s security. In this context, machine learning can play a crucial role in adapting the capabilities of computer networks to recognize current and evolving phishing patterns. In this paper, we present PhishNot, a phishing URL detection system based on machine learning. Hence, our work uses a primarily ”learning from data” driven approach, validated with a representative scenario and dataset. The input features were reduced to 14 to assure the system’s practical applicability. Experiments showed that Random Forest presented the best performance with a very high accuracy of 97.5%. Furthermore, the design of our system also lends itself to being more adoptable in practice through a combination of high phishing detection rate and high speed (an average of

82,"Novel security models, metrics and security assessment for maritime vessel networks","In the past few years, maritime vessels have become computerized and connected to the internet. However, with this technology, critical systems based on-board ships that manage the vessel’s navigation system, radar, cargo management system, etc have become more prone to cyber-attacks. Moreover, attackers are now becoming aware of the vulnerabilities associated with such maritime vessel systems. As a result, it is of vital importance to manage and secure the maritime vessel networks against cyber-attacks, but there is a lack of capabilities to efficiently manage the identifications of vulnerabilities, security risk assessment, and evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures. Hence, we propose a novel framework and security risk modeling and assessment method to evaluate the security of maritime vessel networks. We develop (1) a security model for maritime vessels to capture probabilistic events, vulnerabilities, and network configurations of vessel components; (2) propose an approach to assess the network with a single function, multiple functions, and the inter-dependencies between the functions as attack goal(s); (3) adopt three well-defined security metrics with the proposed model to evaluate possible attacks and/or threats; and (4) compare the effectiveness of cyber-defense strategies based on different attack scenarios on the maritime vessel network. Besides, we perform sensitivity analysis based on temporal and permanent connections that are associated with the vessels’ systems to understand the effect of the connections on security. Our results demonstrate the applicability and usability of the proposed model for finding potential attack paths, assessing security, and mitigating the impact of cyber-attacks and threats on a vessel network.","Simon Yusuf Enoch , Jang Se Lee , Dong Seong Kim",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128621000797,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,past year maritim vessel becom computer connect internet howev technolog critic system base onboard ship manag vessel ’ navig system radar cargo manag system etc becom prone cyberattack moreov attack becom awar vulner associ maritim vessel system result vital import manag secur maritim vessel network cyberattack lack capabl effici manag identif vulner secur risk assess evalu effect countermeasur henc propos novel framework secur risk model assess method evalu secur maritim vessel network develop 1 secur model maritim vessel captur probabilist event vulner network configur vessel compon 2 propos approach assess network singl function multipl function interdepend function attack goal 3 adopt three welldefin secur metric propos model evalu possibl attack andor threat 4 compar effect cyberdefens strategi base differ attack scenario maritim vessel network besid perform sensit analysi base tempor perman connect associ vessel ’ system understand effect connect secur result demonstr applic usabl propos model find potenti attack path assess secur mitig impact cyberattack threat vessel network,novel secur model metric secur assess maritim vessel network,novel secur model metric secur assess maritim vessel network past year maritim vessel becom computer connect internet howev technolog critic system base onboard ship manag vessel ’ navig system radar cargo manag system etc becom prone cyberattack moreov attack becom awar vulner associ maritim vessel system result vital import manag secur maritim vessel network cyberattack lack capabl effici manag identif vulner secur risk assess evalu effect countermeasur henc propos novel framework secur risk model assess method evalu secur maritim vessel network develop 1 secur model maritim vessel captur probabilist event vulner network configur vessel compon 2 propos approach assess network singl function multipl function interdepend function attack goal 3 adopt three welldefin secur metric propos model evalu possibl attack andor threat 4 compar effect cyberdefens strategi base differ attack scenario maritim vessel network besid perform sensit analysi base tempor perman connect associ vessel ’ system understand effect connect secur result demonstr applic usabl propos model find potenti attack path assess secur mitig impact cyberattack threat vessel network
83,Real-time bot infection detection system using DNS fingerprinting and machine-learning,"In today’s cyberattacks, botnets are used as an advanced technique to generate sophisticated and coordinated attacks. Infected systems connect to a command and control (C&C) server to receive commands and attack. Thus, detecting infected hosts makes it possible to protect the network’s resources and prevent them from illicit activities toward third parties. This research elaborates on the design, implementation, and results of a bot infection detection system based on Domain Name System (DNS) traffic events for a network corporation. An infection detection feasibility analysis is performed by creating fingerprints. The traces are generated from a numerical analysis of 13 attributes. These attributes are obtained from the DNS logs of a DNS server. It looks for fingerprint anomalies using Isolation Forest to label a host as infected or not. In addition, on the traces cataloged as anomalous, a search will be carried out for queries to domains generated by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA).

84,Enhancing smart city IoT communication: A two-layer NOMA-based network with caching mechanisms and optimized resource allocation,"With advancements in next-generation communication systems, large-scale Internet of Things device (IoTDs) deployments in smart cities face challenges like limited bandwidth, high latency, and network congestion. To address this, we propose a two-layer network architecture utilizing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and caching to enhance IoT communications’ performance, efficiency, and reliability. Our primary objective is to optimize resource allocation and solve the association problem in a two-layer network. We formulated a joint optimization problem to maximize system utility through device association, power, and bandwidth allocation, considering constraints like channel quality and interference. We decoupled the non-linear, non-convex problem using block coordinate descent (BCD) and inner approximation techniques to maximize the aggregated data rate in high-density IoT scenarios. This approach reduced computational complexity while proving the scheme’s theoretical and numerical convergence. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we compared its performance with an ideal backhauling approach, an exhaustive search (upper bound), and a Genetic algorithm-based heuristic. Our scheme outperformed the others, achieving 98.04% of the ideal backhauling and 99.60% of the upper bound. Statistical analysis confirmed its robustness and consistent performance across various conditions. The two-layer NOMA-based network with caching and optimized resource allocation significantly enhances IoT communication efficiency and resilience, offering a solid framework for future smart city deployments.","Tareq M.

85,TNN-IDS: Transformer neural network-based intrusion detection system for MQTT-enabled IoT Networks,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a global network that connects a large number of smart devices. MQTT is a de facto standard, lightweight, and reliable protocol for machine-to-machine communication, widely adopted in IoT networks. Various smart devices within these networks are employed to handle sensitive information. However, the scale and openness of IoT networks make them highly vulnerable to security breaches and attacks, such as eavesdropping, weak authentication, and malicious payloads. Hence, there is a need for advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Existing ML-based IoT-IDSs face several limitations in effectively detecting malicious activities, mainly due to imbalanced training data. To address this, this study introduces a transformer neural network-based intrusion detection system (TNN-IDS) specifically designed for MQTT-enabled IoT networks. The proposed approach aims to enhance the detection of malicious activities within these networks. The TNN-IDS leverages the parallel processing capability of the Transformer Neural Network, which accelerates the learning process and results in improved detection of malicious attacks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, it was compared with various IDSs based on ML and DL approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TNN-IDS outperforms other systems in terms of detecting malicious activity. The TNN-IDS achieved optimum accuracies reaching 99.9% in detecting malicious activities.","Safi Ullah , Jawad Ahmad , Muazzam A.

86,SmartDefense: A distributed deep defense against DDoS attacks with edge computing,"The growing number of IoT edge devices have inflicted a change in the cyber-attack space. The DDoS attacks, in particular, have significantly increased in magnitude and intensity. Of the existing DDoS solutions, while the destination-based defense mechanisms incur high false positives due to the seemingly legitimate nature of the attack traffic, defense mechanisms implemented at the source alone do not suffice due to the lack of visibility into ongoing DDoS attacks. This paper proposes a distributed DDoS detection and mitigation framework, SmartDefense, based on edge computing approaches towards detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks at and near the source. By mitigating the DDoS attacks near the source, SmartDefense significantly reduces unnecessary bandwidth otherwise consumed by DDoS traffic going from residential edge networks to the ISP edge network.
Furthermore, SmartDefense demonstrates how ISPs can detect botnet devices in their customer’s network by having smart edge devices pass attributes that are processed by the botnet detection engine at the provider’s edge. The evaluation of this work shows that SmartDefense can improve the detection and mitigation rate, with over 90% of DDoS traffic caught at the source and over 97.5% of remaining DDoS traffic caught at the provider’s edge. Our experiments also demonstrate how using a botnet detection engine can further reduce the DDoS traffic by up to 51.95% by facilitating ISPs to detect bot devices in their customers’ edge network.","Sowmya Myneni , Ankur Chowdhary , Dijiang Huang , Adel Alshamrani",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128622000792,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,grow number iot edg devic inflict chang cyberattack space ddo attack particular significantli increas magnitud intens exist ddo solut destinationbas defens mechan incur high fals posit due seemingli legitim natur attack traffic defens mechan implement sourc alon suffic due lack visibl ongo ddo attack paper propos distribut ddo detect mitig framework smartdefens base edg comput approach toward detect mitig ddo attack near sourc mitig ddo attack near sourc smartdefens significantli reduc unnecessari bandwidth otherwis consum ddo traffic go residenti edg network isp edg network furthermor smartdefens demonstr isp detect botnet devic custom ’ network smart edg devic pass attribut process botnet detect engin provid ’ edg evalu work show smartdefens improv detect mitig rate 90 ddo traffic caught sourc 975 remain ddo traffic caught provid ’ edg experi also demonstr use botnet detect engin reduc ddo traffic 5195 facilit isp detect bot devic custom ’ edg network,smartdefens distribut deep defens ddo attack edg comput,smartdefens distribut deep defens ddo attack edg comput grow number iot edg devic inflict chang cyberattack space ddo attack particular significantli increas magnitud intens exist ddo solut destinationbas defens mechan incur high fals posit due seemingli legitim natur attack traffic defens mechan implement sourc alon suffic due lack visibl ongo ddo attack paper propos distribut ddo detect mitig framework smartdefens base edg comput approach toward detect mitig ddo attack near sourc mitig ddo attack near sourc smartdefens significantli reduc unnecessari bandwidth otherwis consum ddo traffic go residenti edg network isp edg network furthermor smartdefens demonstr isp detect botnet devic custom ’ network smart edg devic pass attribut process botnet detect engin provid ’ edg evalu work show smartdefens improv detect mitig rate 90 ddo traffic caught sourc 975 remain ddo traffic caught provid ’ edg experi also demonstr use botnet detect engin reduc ddo traffic 5195 facilit isp detect bot devic custom ’ edg network

88,Malware communication in smart factories: A network traffic data set,"Machine learning-based intrusion detection requires suitable and realistic data sets for training and testing. However, data sets that originate from real networks are rare. Network data is considered privacy sensitive and the purposeful introduction of malicious traffic is usually not possible. In this paper we introduce a labeled data set captured at a smart factory located in Vienna, Austria during normal operation and during penetration tests with different attack types. The data set consists of 173 GB of Packet Capture (PCAP) files, which represent 16 days (395 h) of factory operation. It includes Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Modbus/TCP traffic. The captured malicious traffic was originated by a professional penetration tester who performed two types of attacks: (a) aggressive attacks that are easier to detect and (b) stealthy attacks that are harder to detect. Our data set includes the raw PCAP files and extracted flow data. Labels for packets and flows indicate whether packets (or flows) originated from a specific attack or from benign communication. We describe the methodology for creating the data set, conduct an analysis of the data and provide detailed information about the recorded traffic itself. The data set is freely available to support reproducible research and the comparability of results in the area of intrusion detection in industrial networks.","Bernhard Brenner , Joachim Fabini , Magnus Offermanns",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624006364,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,machin learningbas intrus detect requir suitabl realist data set train test howev data set origin real network rare network data consid privaci sensit purpos introduct malici traffic usual possibl paper introduc label data set captur smart factori locat vienna austria normal oper penetr test differ attack type data set consist 173 gb packet captur pcap file repres 16 day 395 h factori oper includ messag queu telemetri transport mqtt opc unifi architectur opc ua modbustcp traffic captur malici traffic origin profession penetr tester perform two type attack aggress attack easier detect b stealthi attack harder detect data set includ raw pcap file extract flow data label packet flow indic whether packet flow origin specif attack benign commun describ methodolog creat data set conduct analysi data provid detail inform record traffic data set freeli avail support reproduc research compar result area intrus detect industri network,malwar commun smart factori network traffic data set,malwar commun smart factori network traffic data set machin learningbas intrus detect requir suitabl realist data set train test howev data set origin real network rare network data consid privaci sensit purpos introduct malici traffic usual possibl paper introduc label data set captur smart factori locat vienna austria normal oper penetr test differ attack type data set consist 173 gb packet captur pcap file repres 16 day 395 h factori oper includ messag queu telemetri transport mqtt opc unifi architectur opc ua modbustcp traffic captur malici traffic origin profession penetr tester perform two type attack aggress attack easier detect b stealthi attack harder detect data set includ raw pcap file extract flow data label packet flow indic whether packet flow origin specif attack benign commun describ methodolog creat data set conduct analysi data provid detail inform record traffic data set freeli avail support reproduc research compar result area intrus detect industri network
89,Performance evaluation of the SRE and SBPG components of the IoT hardware platform security advisor framework,"The applications of Internet of Things (IoT) and associated technologies have been spreading rapidly across a wide range of domains, including environmental monitoring, home automation, and supply chain, having a significant bearing on the social and economic well-being of humans as well as enhancing environmental sustainability. In recent years, however, there have been several data breaches and other security and privacy incidents involving IoT devices, which have attracted significant attention from the research community in both academia and industry. This has resulted in a surge of proposals put forward by many researchers, including IoT blockchain-based security solutions, IoT intrusion detection systems, IoT authentication systems, and IoT security analytics. While these proposals are aimed at addressing various IoT security and privacy-related issues, many of these solutions arguably seem not to focus on helping designers and developers with little or no security expertise in start-up companies to produce secure IoT systems. To this end, the IoT Hardware Platform Security Advisor (IoT-HarPSecA) framework was proposed to foster the design and implementation of secure IoT systems. In this paper, we present the performance and usability evaluation of the Security Requirements Elicitation (SRE) and Security Best Practice Guidelines (SBPG) component tools of IoT-HarPSecA, which are two of the three component tools of the security framework. Results show that the two components of the IoT-HarPSecA framework can facilitate the development of secure IoT systems and that the SRE and SBPG tools are easy to use.","Musa G.

90,"Synchronizing DDoS defense at network edge with P4, SDN, and Blockchain","Botnet-originated DDoS attacks continue to plague the internet and disrupt services for legitimate users. While various proposals have been presented in the last two decades, the botnet still has advantages over the defenders, because botnets have orchestrated processes to launch disruptive attacks. On the other hand, the defenders use manual methods, siloed tools, and lack orchestration among different organizations. These unorchestrated efforts slow down the attack response and extend the lifespan of botnet attacks. This article presents shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN, an inter-organization collaborative defense framework using P4, SDN, and Blockchain, which extends our earlier research on microVNF, a solution of Edge security for SIP-enabled IoT devices with P4. Besides mitigating DDoS attacks, microVNF also produces attack fingerprints called Indicator of Compromise (IOC) records. ShieldSDN and shieldCHAIN distribute these IOCs to other organizations so that they can create their own packet filters. Effectively, shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN synchronize packet filters for different organizations to mitigate against the same botnet strain. Four experiments were performed successfully to validate the functionalities of shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN. The scope for the first experiment was intra-company, while the second, third, and fourth experiments were inter-company. In the first experiment, shieldSDN extracted IOCs from the source switch and installed these as packet filters on other switches within the same organization (in the U.S.). In the second experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the publishing organization (in the U.S.) shared IOCs by posting them to the Blockchain. In the third experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations (in Singapore & the U.K.) retrieved these IOCs from Blockchain. Finally, in the last experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations installed the retrieved IOCs as packet filters; that are identical to those in the originating organization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that uses the P4 switch, SDN controller, and Blockchain together for this use case. As SDN and Blockchain gain acceptance, this framework empowers community members to collaborate and defend against botnet DDoS attacks.","Aldo Febro , Hannan Xiao , Joseph Spring , Bruce Christianson ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128622003310,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,botnetorigin ddo attack continu plagu internet disrupt servic legitim user variou propos present last two decad botnet still advantag defend botnet orchestr process launch disrupt attack hand defend use manual method silo tool lack orchestr among differ organ unorchestr effort slow attack respons extend lifespan botnet attack articl present shieldsdn shieldchain interorgan collabor defens framework use p4 sdn blockchain extend earlier research microvnf solut edg secur sipen iot devic p4 besid mitig ddo attack microvnf also produc attack fingerprint call indic compromis ioc record shieldsdn shieldchain distribut ioc organ creat packet filter effect shieldsdn shieldchain synchron packet filter differ organ mitig botnet strain four experi perform success valid function shieldsdn shieldchain scope first experi intracompani second third fourth experi intercompani first experi shieldsdn extract ioc sourc switch instal packet filter switch within organ us second experi shieldchain publish organ us share ioc post blockchain third experi shieldchain subscrib organ singapor uk retriev ioc blockchain final last experi shieldchain subscrib organ instal retriev ioc packet filter ident origin organ best knowledg first framework use p4 switch sdn control blockchain togeth use case sdn blockchain gain accept framework empow commun member collabor defend botnet ddo attack,synchron ddo defens network edg p4 sdn blockchain,synchron ddo defens network edg p4 sdn blockchain botnetorigin ddo attack continu plagu internet disrupt servic legitim user variou propos present last two decad botnet still advantag defend botnet orchestr process launch disrupt attack hand defend use manual method silo tool lack orchestr among differ organ unorchestr effort slow attack respons extend lifespan botnet attack articl present shieldsdn shieldchain interorgan collabor defens framework use p4 sdn blockchain extend earlier research microvnf solut edg secur sipen iot devic p4 besid mitig ddo attack microvnf also produc attack fingerprint call indic compromis ioc record shieldsdn shieldchain distribut ioc organ creat packet filter effect shieldsdn shieldchain synchron packet filter differ organ mitig botnet strain four experi perform success valid function shieldsdn shieldchain scope first experi intracompani second third fourth experi intercompani first experi shieldsdn extract ioc sourc switch instal packet filter switch within organ us second experi shieldchain publish organ us share ioc post blockchain third experi shieldchain subscrib organ singapor uk retriev ioc blockchain final last experi shieldchain subscrib organ instal retriev ioc packet filter ident origin organ best knowledg first framework use p4 switch sdn control blockchain togeth use case sdn blockchain gain accept framework empow commun member collabor defend botnet ddo attack
91,"Intelligent zero trust architecture for 5G/6G networks: Principles, challenges, and the role of machine learning in the context of O-RAN","In this position paper, we discuss the critical need for integrating zero trust (ZT) principles into next-generation communication networks (5G/6G). We highlight the challenges and introduce the concept of an intelligent zero trust architecture (i-ZTA) as a security framework in 5G/6G networks with untrusted components. While network virtualization, software-defined networking (SDN), and service-based architectures (SBA) are key enablers of 5G networks, operating in an untrusted environment has also become a key feature of the networks. Further, seamless connectivity to a high volume of devices has broadened the attack surface on information infrastructure. Network assurance in a dynamic untrusted environment calls for revolutionary architectures beyond existing static security frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first position paper that presents the architectural concept design of an i-ZTA upon which modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be developed to provide information security in untrusted networks. We introduce key ZT principles as real-time Monitoring of the security state of network assets, Evaluating the risk of individual access requests, and Deciding on access authorization using a dynamic trust algorithm, called MED components. To ensure ease of integration, the envisioned architecture adopts an SBA-based design, similar to the 3GPP specification of 5G networks, by leveraging the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture with appropriate real-time engines and network interfaces for collecting necessary machine learning data. Therefore, this work provides novel research directions to design machine learning based components that contribute towards i-ZTA for the future 5G/6G networks.","Keyvan Ramezanpour , Jithin Jagannath ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128622003929,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,posit paper discuss critic need integr zero trust zt principl nextgener commun network 5g6g highlight challeng introduc concept intellig zero trust architectur izta secur framework 5g6g network untrust compon network virtual softwaredefin network sdn servicebas architectur sba key enabl 5g network oper untrust environ also becom key featur network seamless connect high volum devic broaden attack surfac inform infrastructur network assur dynam untrust environ call revolutionari architectur beyond exist static secur framework best knowledg first posit paper present architectur concept design izta upon modern artifici intellig ai algorithm develop provid inform secur untrust network introduc key zt principl realtim monitor secur state network asset evalu risk individu access request decid access author use dynam trust algorithm call med compon ensur eas integr envis architectur adopt sbabas design similar 3gpp specif 5g network leverag open radio access network oran architectur appropri realtim engin network interfac collect necessari machin learn data therefor work provid novel research direct design machin learn base compon contribut toward izta futur 5g6g network,intellig zero trust architectur 5g6g network principl challeng role machin learn context oran,intellig zero trust architectur 5g6g network principl challeng role machin learn context oran posit paper discuss critic need integr zero trust zt principl nextgener commun network 5g6g highlight challeng introduc concept intellig zero trust architectur izta secur framework 5g6g network untrust compon network virtual softwaredefin network sdn servicebas architectur sba key enabl 5g network oper untrust environ also becom key featur network seamless connect high volum devic broaden attack surfac inform infrastructur network assur dynam untrust environ call revolutionari architectur beyond exist static secur framework best knowledg first posit paper present architectur concept design izta upon modern artifici intellig ai algorithm develop provid inform secur untrust network introduc key zt principl realtim monitor secur state network asset evalu risk individu access request decid access author use dynam trust algorithm call med compon ensur eas integr envis architectur adopt sbabas design similar 3gpp specif 5g network leverag open radio access network oran architectur appropri realtim engin network interfac collect necessari machin learn data therefor work provid novel research direct design machin learn base compon contribut toward izta futur 5g6g network
92,Auto-tune POIs: Estimation of distribution algorithms for efficient side-channel analysis,"Due to the constant increase and versatility of IoT devices that should keep sensitive information private, Side-channel Analysis (SCA) attacks on embedded devices are gaining visibility in the industrial field. The integration and validation of countermeasures against SCA can be an expensive and cumbersome process, especially for the less experienced ones. Additionally, current certification procedures require to attack the devices under test using multiple SCA techniques and attack vectors, often implying a high degree of complexity.
The goal of this paper is to introduce a new automatic way to ease one of the most crucial and tedious steps of profiling attacks i.e. the points of interest (POI) selection and hence assist the SCA evaluation process. To this end, we propose the usage of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in the SCA field to perform the point of interest selection step together with the profiling and key recovery steps. This contribution allows an automated optimization of the attack, avoiding the need to manually perform various types of analyses with different POI combinations. We showcase our approach on several experimental use cases, including attacks on unprotected and protected AES implementations. In addition, we introduce a new public dataset containing power traces taken from distinct copies of the same device and perform attacks over this dataset using our method, dismissing in this way the portability issue.","Unai Rioja , Lejla Batina , Jose Luis Flores , Igor Armendariz",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128621003789,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,due constant increas versatil iot devic keep sensit inform privat sidechannel analysi sca attack embed devic gain visibl industri field integr valid countermeasur sca expens cumbersom process especi less experienc one addit current certif procedur requir attack devic test use multipl sca techniqu attack vector often impli high degre complex goal paper introduc new automat way eas one crucial tediou step profil attack ie point interest poi select henc assist sca evalu process end propos usag estim distribut algorithm eda sca field perform point interest select step togeth profil key recoveri step contribut allow autom optim attack avoid need manual perform variou type analys differ poi combin showcas approach sever experiment use case includ attack unprotect protect ae implement addit introduc new public dataset contain power trace taken distinct copi devic perform attack dataset use method dismiss way portabl issu,autotun poi estim distribut algorithm effici sidechannel analysi,autotun poi estim distribut algorithm effici sidechannel analysi due constant increas versatil iot devic keep sensit inform privat sidechannel analysi sca attack embed devic gain visibl industri field integr valid countermeasur sca expens cumbersom process especi less experienc one addit current certif procedur requir attack devic test use multipl sca techniqu attack vector often impli high degre complex goal paper introduc new automat way eas one crucial tediou step profil attack ie point interest poi select henc assist sca evalu process end propos usag estim distribut algorithm eda sca field perform point interest select step togeth profil key recoveri step contribut allow autom optim attack avoid need manual perform variou type analys differ poi combin showcas approach sever experiment use case includ attack unprotect protect ae implement addit introduc new public dataset contain power trace taken distinct copi devic perform attack dataset use method dismiss way portabl issu

The well-known vehicular control flows will follow predefined schedules and TSN traffic classifications. In this paper, we exploit this traffic classification to build a network anomaly detection system. We show how filters and policies of TSN can identify misbehaving traffic and thereby serve as distributed guards on the data link layer. On this lowest possible layer, our approach derives a highly efficient network protection directly from TSN. We classify link layer anomalies and micro-benchmark the detection accuracy in each class. Based on a topology derived from a real-world car and its traffic definitions we evaluate the detection system in realistic macro-benchmarks based on recorded attack traces. Our results show that the detection accuracy depends on how exact the specifications of in-vehicle communication are configured. Most notably for a fully specified communication matrix, our anomaly detection remains free of false-positive alarms, which is a significant benefit for implementing automated countermeasures in future vehicles.","Philipp Meyer, Timo Häckel, Sandra Reider, Franz Korf, Thomas C.

94,Federated learning for malware detection in IoT devices,"Billions of IoT devices lacking proper security mechanisms have been manufactured and deployed for the last years, and more will come with the development of Beyond 5G technologies. Their vulnerability to malware has motivated the need for efficient techniques to detect infected IoT devices inside networks. With data privacy and integrity becoming a major concern in recent years, increasing with the arrival of 5G and Beyond networks, new technologies such as federated learning and blockchain emerged. They allow training machine learning models with decentralized data while preserving its privacy by design. This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant’s privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust.","Valerian Rey , Pedro Miguel Sánchez Sánchez , Alberto Huertas Celdrán , Gérôme Bovet",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128621005582,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,billion iot devic lack proper secur mechan manufactur deploy last year come develop beyond 5g technolog vulner malwar motiv need effici techniqu detect infect iot devic insid network data privaci integr becom major concern recent year increas arriv 5g beyond network new technolog feder learn blockchain emerg allow train machin learn model decentr data preserv privaci design work investig possibl enabl feder learn concern iot malwar detect studi secur issu inher new learn paradigm context framework use feder learn detect malwar affect iot devic present nbaiot dataset model network traffic sever real iot devic affect malwar use evalu propos framework supervis unsupervis feder model multilay perceptron autoencod abl detect malwar affect seen unseen iot devic nbaiot train evalu furthermor perform compar two tradit approach first one let particip local train model use data second consist make particip share data central entiti charg train global model comparison shown use divers larg data done feder central method consider posit impact model perform besid feder model preserv particip ’ privaci show similar result central one addit contribut measur robust feder approach adversari setup sever malici particip poison feder model consid baselin model aggreg averag step use feder learn algorithm appear highli vulner differ attack even singl adversari perform model aggreg function act countermeasur thu evalu attack scenario function provid signific improv malici particip effort still need make feder approach robust,feder learn malwar detect iot devic,feder learn malwar detect iot devic billion iot devic lack proper secur mechan manufactur deploy last year come develop beyond 5g technolog vulner malwar motiv need effici techniqu detect infect iot devic insid network data privaci integr becom major concern recent year increas arriv 5g beyond network new technolog feder learn blockchain emerg allow train machin learn model decentr data preserv privaci design work investig possibl enabl feder learn concern iot malwar detect studi secur issu inher new learn paradigm context framework use feder learn detect malwar affect iot devic present nbaiot dataset model network traffic sever real iot devic affect malwar use evalu propos framework supervis unsupervis feder model multilay perceptron autoencod abl detect malwar affect seen unseen iot devic nbaiot train evalu furthermor perform compar two tradit approach first one let particip local train model use data second consist make particip share data central entiti charg train global model comparison shown use divers larg data done feder central method consider posit impact model perform besid feder model preserv particip ’ privaci show similar result central one addit contribut measur robust feder approach adversari setup sever malici particip poison feder model consid baselin model aggreg averag step use feder learn algorithm appear highli vulner differ attack even singl adversari perform model aggreg function act countermeasur thu evalu attack scenario function provid signific improv malici particip effort still need make feder approach robust
95,Evaluating integration methods of a quantum random number generator in OpenSSL for TLS,"The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses a significant threat to conventional cryptography. Whilst post-quantum cryptography (PQC) stands as the prevailing trend for fortifying the security of cryptographic systems, the coexistence of quantum and classical computing paradigms presents an opportunity to leverage the strengths of both technologies, for instance, nowadays the use of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) – considered as True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) – opens up the possibility of discussing hybrid systems. In this paper, we evaluate both aspects, on the one hand, we use hybrid TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol that leverages the widely used secure protocol on the Internet and integrates PQC algorithms, and, on the other hand, we evaluate two approaches to integrate a QRNG, i.e., Quantis PCIe-240M, in OpenSSL 3.0 to be used by TLS. Both approaches are compared through a Nginx Web server, that uses OpenSSL’s implementation of TLS 1.3 for secure web communication. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing such integration method, because while direct integration can lead to performance penalties specific to the method and hardware used, alternative methods demonstrate the potential for efficient QRNG deployment in cryptographic systems.","Javier Blanco-Romero, Vicente Lorenzo, Florina Almenares, Daniel Díaz-Sánchez, Carlos García Rubio, Celeste Campo, Andrés Marín",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624007096,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,rapid advanc quantum comput pose signific threat convent cryptographi whilst postquantum cryptographi pqc stand prevail trend fortifi secur cryptograph system coexist quantum classic comput paradigm present opportun leverag strength technolog instanc nowaday use quantum random number gener qrng – consid true random number gener trng – open possibl discuss hybrid system paper evalu aspect one hand use hybrid tl transport layer secur protocol leverag wide use secur protocol internet integr pqc algorithm hand evalu two approach integr qrng ie quanti pcie240m openssl 30 use tl approach compar nginx web server use openssl ’ implement tl 13 secur web commun find highlight import optim integr method direct integr lead perform penalti specif method hardwar use altern method demonstr potenti effici qrng deploy cryptograph system,evalu integr method quantum random number gener openssl tl,evalu integr method quantum random number gener openssl tl rapid advanc quantum comput pose signific threat convent cryptographi whilst postquantum cryptographi pqc stand prevail trend fortifi secur cryptograph system coexist quantum classic comput paradigm present opportun leverag strength technolog instanc nowaday use quantum random number gener qrng – consid true random number gener trng – open possibl discuss hybrid system paper evalu aspect one hand use hybrid tl transport layer secur protocol leverag wide use secur protocol internet integr pqc algorithm hand evalu two approach integr qrng ie quanti pcie240m openssl 30 use tl approach compar nginx web server use openssl ’ implement tl 13 secur web commun find highlight import optim integr method direct integr lead perform penalti specif method hardwar use altern method demonstr potenti effici qrng deploy cryptograph system
96,Leveraging Data Plane Programmability to enhance service orchestration at the edge: A focus on industrial security,"The Edge Computing paradigm is increasingly gaining traction in modern telecommunication scenarios, as it enables the offloading of computational tasks from end devices to a variety of nodes located in close proximity to them. This approach is essential for meeting the ever-stricter Quality of Service requirements imposed by modern applications. Concurrently, the advent of Data Plane Programmability allows for unmatched flexibility on the networking plane, supporting processing of multiple protocols in a logically centralized fashion with simple in-line computation, and offering the possibility to offload additional services to networking equipment. Reaping those benefits necessitates heedful management of resources and infrastructure. This, in turn, calls for the introduction of a service orchestration entity, capable of taking advantage of device heterogeneity to enable efficient and swift service provisioning. This work delves into the potential of introducing an orchestration system able to cope with the challenges of offloading security tasks at the Edge. This effort involves developing and implementing novel architectural components that capitalize on the heterogeneous nature of the Edge infrastructure as well as of the Programmable Data Plane as a potential tool for service offloading. To establish the feasibility and performance of this approach, an industrial scenario is considered, where the integrity of data from legacy devices must be ensured. Following an evaluation of the hashing performance of the Programmable Data Plane in comparison to general-purpose devices, a simulation study is conducted on the overall orchestration system, demonstrating the viability of the proposed appr","Gaetano Francesco Pittalà , Lorenzo Rinieri , Amir Al Sadi , Gianluca Davoli , Andrea Melis , Marco Prandini , Walter Cerroni ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624002299,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,edg comput paradigm increasingli gain traction modern telecommun scenario enabl offload comput task end devic varieti node locat close proxim approach essenti meet everstrict qualiti servic requir impos modern applic concurr advent data plane programm allow unmatch flexibl network plane support process multipl protocol logic central fashion simpl inlin comput offer possibl offload addit servic network equip reap benefit necessit heed manag resourc infrastructur turn call introduct servic orchestr entiti capabl take advantag devic heterogen enabl effici swift servic provis work delv potenti introduc orchestr system abl cope challeng offload secur task edg effort involv develop implement novel architectur compon capit heterogen natur edg infrastructur well programm data plane potenti tool servic offload establish feasibl perform approach industri scenario consid integr data legaci devic must ensur follow evalu hash perform programm data plane comparison generalpurpos devic simul studi conduct overal orchestr system demonstr viabil propos appr,leverag data plane programm enhanc servic orchestr edg focu industri secur,leverag data plane programm enhanc servic orchestr edg focu industri secur edg comput paradigm increasingli gain traction modern telecommun scenario enabl offload comput task end devic varieti node locat close proxim approach essenti meet everstrict qualiti servic requir impos modern applic concurr advent data plane programm allow unmatch flexibl network plane support process multipl protocol logic central fashion simpl inlin comput offer possibl offload addit servic network equip reap benefit necessit heed manag resourc infrastructur turn call introduct servic orchestr entiti capabl take advantag devic heterogen enabl effici swift servic provis work delv potenti introduc orchestr system abl cope challeng offload secur task edg effort involv develop implement novel architectur compon capit heterogen natur edg infrastructur well programm data plane potenti tool servic offload establish feasibl perform approach industri scenario consid integr data legaci devic must ensur follow evalu hash perform programm data plane comparison generalpurpos devic simul studi conduct overal orchestr system demonstr viabil propos appr
97,Q-ICAN: A Q-learning based cache pollution attack mitigation approach for named data networking,"The Cache Pollution Attack (CPA) is a recent threat that poses a significant risk to Named Data Networks (NDN). This attack can impact the caching process in various ways, such as causing increased cache misses for legitimate users, delays in data retrieval, and exhaustion of resources in NDN routers. Despite the numerous countermeasures suggested in the literature for CPA, many of them have detrimental effects on the NDN components. In this paper, we introduce Q-ICAN, a novel intelligent technique for detecting and mitigating cache pollution attacks in NDN. More specifically, Q-ICAN uses Q-Learning as an automated CPA prediction mechanism. Each NDN router integrates a reinforcement learning agent that utilizes impactful metrics such as the variation of the Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) and the interest inter-arrival time to learn how to differentiate between malicious and legitimate interests. We conducted several simulations using NDNSim to assess the effectiveness of our solution in terms of Cache Hit Ratio (CHR), Average Retrieval Delay (ARD) and multiple artificial intelligence evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. The obtained results confirm that Q-ICAN detects CPA attacks with a 95.09% accuracy rate, achieves a 94% CHR, and reduces ARD by 18%. Additionally, Q-ICAN adheres to the security policy of the NDN architecture and consumes fewer resources from NDN routers compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions.","Abdelhak Hidouri , Haifa Touati , Mohamed Hadded , Nasreddine Hajlaoui , Paul Muhlethaler , Samia Bouzefrane",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128623004437,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,cach pollut attack cpa recent threat pose signific risk name data network ndn attack impact cach process variou way caus increas cach miss legitim user delay data retriev exhaust resourc ndn router despit numer countermeasur suggest literatur cpa mani detriment effect ndn compon paper introduc qican novel intellig techniqu detect mitig cach pollut attack ndn specif qican use qlearn autom cpa predict mechan ndn router integr reinforc learn agent util impact metric variat cach hit ratio chr interest interarriv time learn differenti malici legitim interest conduct sever simul use ndnsim assess effect solut term cach hit ratio chr averag retriev delay ard multipl artifici intellig evalu metric accuraci precis recal etc obtain result confirm qican detect cpa attack 9509 accuraci rate achiev 94 chr reduc ard 18 addit qican adher secur polici ndn architectur consum fewer resourc ndn router compar exist stateoftheart solut,qican qlearn base cach pollut attack mitig approach name data network,qican qlearn base cach pollut attack mitig approach name data network cach pollut attack cpa recent threat pose signific risk name data network ndn attack impact cach process variou way caus increas cach miss legitim user delay data retriev exhaust resourc ndn router despit numer countermeasur suggest literatur cpa mani detriment effect ndn compon paper introduc qican novel intellig techniqu detect mitig cach pollut attack ndn specif qican use qlearn autom cpa predict mechan ndn router integr reinforc learn agent util impact metric variat cach hit ratio chr interest interarriv time learn differenti malici legitim interest conduct sever simul use ndnsim assess effect solut term cach hit ratio chr averag retriev delay ard multipl artifici intellig evalu metric accuraci precis recal etc obtain result confirm qican detect cpa attack 9509 accuraci rate achiev 94 chr reduc ard 18 addit qican adher secur polici ndn architectur consum fewer resourc ndn router compar exist stateoftheart solut
98,Online Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) intrusion detection based on adaptive sliding window and morphological fractal dimension,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks are important threats to network services and applications. Studies in literature have proposed various approaches including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) based on the application of machine learning and deep learning, but their computational cost can be significant. For this reason, other studies have proposed efficient IDS algorithms based on the online real-time analysis of the network traffic with a sliding window and entropy or other statistical measures. This paper proposes an online algorithm based on a sliding window with the novel application of the Morphological Fractal Dimension (MFD) to this problem. The results presented in this study show that the application of MFD to the recent CICIDS2017 public data set can obtain a significant improvement in the detection of the DDoS attack in comparison to entropy based approaches. In addition, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for the automatic definition of the sliding window size. This paper reports the impact of the different hyper-parameters, including the parameters present in the definition of MFD and the evaluation of the distance measures, where the Chebyschev distance provides the optimal detection accuracy. The results show a detection accuracy of 99.30%, which performs better than similar approaches on the same data set.","Gianmarco Baldini , Irene Amerini",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138912862200113X,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,distribut denial servic ddo attack import threat network servic applic studi literatur propos variou approach includ intrus detect system id base applic machin learn deep learn comput cost signific reason studi propos effici id algorithm base onlin realtim analysi network traffic slide window entropi statist measur paper propos onlin algorithm base slide window novel applic morpholog fractal dimens mfd problem result present studi show applic mfd recent cicids2017 public data set obtain signific improv detect ddo attack comparison entropi base approach addit paper propos novel algorithm automat definit slide window size paper report impact differ hyperparamet includ paramet present definit mfd evalu distanc measur chebyschev distanc provid optim detect accuraci result show detect accuraci 9930 perform better similar approach data set,onlin distribut denial servic ddo intrus detect base adapt slide window morpholog fractal dimens,onlin distribut denial servic ddo intrus detect base adapt slide window morpholog fractal dimens distribut denial servic ddo attack import threat network servic applic studi literatur propos variou approach includ intrus detect system id base applic machin learn deep learn comput cost signific reason studi propos effici id algorithm base onlin realtim analysi network traffic slide window entropi statist measur paper propos onlin algorithm base slide window novel applic morpholog fractal dimens mfd problem result present studi show applic mfd recent cicids2017 public data set obtain signific improv detect ddo attack comparison entropi base approach addit paper propos novel algorithm automat definit slide window size paper report impact differ hyperparamet includ paramet present definit mfd evalu distanc measur chebyschev distanc provid optim detect accuraci result show detect accuraci 9930 perform better similar approach data set
99,Comparative analysis of DNS over HTTPS detectors,"DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol that encrypts DNS traffic to improve user privacy and security. However, its use also poses challenges for network operators and security analysts who need to detect and monitor network traffic for security purposes. Therefore, there are multiple DoH detection proposals that leverage machine learning to identify DoH connections; however, these proposals were often tested on different datasets, and their evaluation methodologies were not consistent enough to allow direct performance comparison. In this study, seven DoH detection proposals were recreated and evaluated with six different experiments to answer research questions that targeted specific deployment scenarios concerning ML-model transferability, usability, and longevity. For thorough testing, a large Collection of DoH datasets along with a novel 5-week dataset was used, which enabled the evaluation of models’ longevity. This study provides insights into the current state of DoH detection techniques and evaluates the models in scenarios that have not been previously tested. Therefore, this paper goes beyond classical replication studies and shows previously unknown properties of seven published DoH detectors.","Kamil Jerabek , Karel Hynek , Ondrej Rysavy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128624002846,Networking and Cyber Security,,,,dn http doh protocol encrypt dn traffic improv user privaci secur howev use also pose challeng network oper secur analyst need detect monitor network traffic secur purpos therefor multipl doh detect propos leverag machin learn identifi doh connect howev propos often test differ dataset evalu methodolog consist enough allow direct perform comparison studi seven doh detect propos recreat evalu six differ experi answer research question target specif deploy scenario concern mlmodel transfer usabl longev thorough test larg collect doh dataset along novel 5week dataset use enabl evalu model ’ longev studi provid insight current state doh detect techniqu evalu model scenario previous test therefor paper goe beyond classic replic studi show previous unknown properti seven publish doh detector,compar analysi dn http detector,compar analysi dn http detector dn http doh protocol encrypt dn traffic improv user privaci secur howev use also pose challeng network oper secur analyst need detect monitor network traffic secur purpos therefor multipl doh detect propos leverag machin learn identifi doh connect howev propos often test differ dataset evalu methodolog consist enough allow direct perform comparison studi seven doh detect propos recreat evalu six differ experi answer research question target specif deploy scenario concern mlmodel transfer usabl longev thorough test larg collect doh dataset along novel 5week dataset use enabl evalu model ’ longev studi provid insight current state doh detect techniqu evalu model scenario previous test therefor paper goe beyond classic replic studi show previous unknown properti seven publish doh detector
100,BFLS: Blockchain and Federated Learning for sharing threat detection models as Cyber Threat Intelligence,"Recently, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing has become an important weapon for cyber defenders to mitigate the increasing number of cyber attacks in a proactive and collaborative manner. However, with the dramatic increase in the deployment of shared communications between organizations, data has been a major priority to detect threats in the CTI sharing platform. In the modern environment, a valuable asset is the user’s threat data. Privacy policies are necessary to ensure the security of user data in the threat intelligence sharing community. Federated learning acts as a special machine learning technique for privacy preservation and offers to contextualize data in a CTI sharing platform. Therefore, this article proposes a new approach to threat intelligence sharing called BFLS (Blockchain and Federated Learning for sharing threat detection models as Cyber Threat Intelligence), where blockchain-based CTI sharing platforms are used for security and privacy. Federated learning technology is adopted for scalable machine learning applications, such as threat detection. Furthermore, users can obtain a well-trained threat detection model without sending personal data to the central server. Experimental results on the ISCX-IDS-2012 and CIC-DDoS-2019 datasets showed that BFLS can securely share CTI and has high accuracy in threat detection. The accuracies of BFLS are 98.92% and 98.56% on the two datasets, respectively.","Tongtong Jiang , Guowei Shen , Chun Guo , Yunhe Cui , Bo Xie ",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138912862300049X,Networking and Cyber Security,https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?pub=Computer%20Networks&cid=271990&qs=cybersecurity&offset=75,,,recent cyber threat intellig cti share becom import weapon cyber defend mitig increas number cyber attack proactiv collabor manner howev dramat increas deploy share commun organ data major prioriti detect threat cti share platform modern environ valuabl asset user ’ threat data privaci polici necessari ensur secur user data threat intellig share commun feder learn act special machin learn techniqu privaci preserv offer contextu data cti share platform therefor articl propos new approach threat intellig share call bfl blockchain feder learn share threat detect model cyber threat intellig blockchainbas cti share platform use secur privaci feder learn technolog adopt scalabl machin learn applic threat detect furthermor user obtain welltrain threat detect model without send person data central server experiment result iscxids2012 cicddos2019 dataset show bfl secur share cti high accuraci threat detect accuraci bfl 9892 9856 two dataset respect,bfl blockchain feder learn share threat detect model cyber threat intellig,bfl blockchain feder learn share threat detect model cyber threat intellig recent cyber threat intellig cti share becom import weapon cyber defend mitig increas number cyber attack proactiv collabor manner howev dramat increas deploy share commun organ data major prioriti detect threat cti share platform modern environ valuabl asset user ’ threat data privaci polici necessari ensur secur user data threat intellig share commun feder learn act special machin learn techniqu privaci preserv offer contextu data cti share platform therefor articl propos new approach threat intellig share call bfl blockchain feder learn share threat detect model cyber threat intellig blockchainbas cti share platform use secur privaci feder learn technolog adopt scalabl machin learn applic threat detect furthermor user obtain welltrain threat detect model without send person data central server experiment result iscxids2012 cicddos2019 dataset show bfl secur share cti high accuraci threat detect accuraci bfl 9892 9856 two dataset respect

6,An Automatic Nuclei Cells Counting Approach Using Effective Image Processing Methods,"Manual counting of nuclei cells from histological images is considered tedious process, time-consuming and subjected to human errors. Therefore, automated the process of nuclei cells counting is become important and necessary for effective analyzing of histological images. Current systems and approaches of nuclei cells counting are based on color or grayscale images leading to inaccurate results and have several limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel accurate approach for automatic nuclei cells counting using effective image processing methods. The new techniques are designed based on image thresholding method, morphological image processing operations, and connected component algorithm. The new approach was evaluated experimentally on 37 images of a public data set of 100 histological images. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach achieved a high accuracy up to 89.5% compared with previous works. We concluded the effectiveness of the proposed approach for automatic counting of nuclei cells from histological images.","M. A. A. Mosleh, A. A. AL-Yamni and A.

9,OpenCLIPER: An OpenCL-Based C++ Framework for Overhead-Reduced Medical Image Processing and Reconstruction on Heterogeneous Devices,"Medical image processing is often limited by the computational cost of the involved algorithms. Whereas dedicated computing devices (GPUs in particular) exist and do provide significant efficiency boosts, they have an extra cost of use in terms of housekeeping tasks (device selection and initialization, data streaming, synchronization with the CPU, and others), which may hinder developers from using them. This paper describes an OpenCL-based framework that is capable of handling dedicated computing devices seamlessly and that allows the developer to concentrate on image processing tasks. The framework handles automatically device discovery and initialization, data transfers to and from the device and the file system and kernel loading and compiling. Data structures need to be defined only once independently of the computing device; code is unique, consequently, for every device, including the host CPU. Pinned memory/buffer mapping is used to achieve maximum performance in data transfers. Code fragments included in the paper show how the computing device is almost immediately and effortlessly available to the users algorithms, so they can focus on productive work. Code required for device selection and initialization, data loading and streaming and kernel compilation is minimal and systematic. Algorithms can be thought of as mathematical operators (called processes), with input, output and parameters, and they may be chained one after another easily and efficiently. Also for efficiency, processes can have their initialization work split from their core workload, so process chains and loops do not incur in performance penalties. Algorithm code is independent of the device type targeted.",F.

22,Hotspot Detection of Solar Photovoltaic System: A Perspective from Image Processing,"Research in solar energy has rapidly grown since its significant and contributes to the advancement in clean renewable energy technology. Effective energy management such as fault detection impacts the early-stage monitoring for the efficiency, reliability, and safety of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The formation of a hotspot is one of the issues commonly occurred in a PV system. However, the main limitation of hotspot detection is the difficulty to interpret specific components with erratic temperatures in the thermographic images for attributes in the intelligence detection model. In this study, a review of hotspot detection in solar PV panels using the image processing method is established based on the image processing field. The integration of image processing approach can further assist in developing automated fault detection in solar PV farms for effective preventive monitoring methods. Therefore, several aspects need to be categorized and considered accordingly for achieving accurate prediction. Several ways were discussed, and future research is suggested in this study.","N. H.

23,Weakly Supervised Estimation of Shadow Confidence Maps in Fetal Ultrasound Imaging,"Detecting acoustic shadows in ultrasound images is important in many clinical and engineering applications. Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can guide sonographers to a standardized diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional information for other automatic image analysis algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions using learning-based algorithms is challenging because pixel-wise ground truth annotation of acoustic shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of acoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense shadow-focused confidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general shadow features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level annotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained binary shadow segmentation to a reference confidence map. In addition, a confidence estimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and the reference confidence maps. This network is able to predict shadow confidence maps directly from input images during inference. We use evaluation metrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation, and so on, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method is more consistent than human annotation and outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow segmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow confidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view image fusion, and automated biometric measurements.",Q.

25,Modelling and Simulation of Smart Traffic Light System for Emergency Vehicle using Image Processing Techniques,"traffic signal due to the drawbacks of the conventional traffic light system. In the existing traffic light system, a defined timer system is used and it is working based on preset timing. Due to the preset timing, there is no flexibility of ON/OFF in the signal light based on the emergency vehicle and congestion of the vehicle. Sometimes emergency vehicle like an ambulance needs to wait at a traffic signal for a long time and this would lead to a risk to a patient's life. Traffic police must personally identify an ambulance and release the congestion, but this is not possible as there are an enormous number of vehicles present these days. This project aims to providea solution for the issue in the conventional system. The model was designed using an image processing system that reads the image and determines the presence of an emergency vehicle and the density of vehicles in each lane the ON/OFF signal for the particular lane will be given to the traffic light system which helpsto reduce the unnecessary waiting time of vehicles. The system calculates the vehicle's density and to detect the emergency vehicle using image processing to provide the green light signal tothe lane. This project used Open CV and Yolo (you only look once)algorithm in the image processing method to develop the system. The simulation has been done on the proposed smart traffic systemand it identifies that the proposed system is efficient. Multiple times of programming and testing have been done on the proposedsystem to ensure accuracy and for validation.","S. J. Arul, M. B. S, S. L, Sufiyan, G. Kaliyaperumal and J. K.

26,Quantitative evaluation of morphological characteristics of road coarse aggregates based on image processing technology,"To quantitatively characterize and evaluate the morphological features of coarse aggregate particles, 2D images of coarse aggregate particles were processed by using Image Pro-Plus software in this paper. Through image enhancement, correction, segmentation, and retrieval, six morphological indicators such as axial coefficient, rectangularity, roundness, roughness, angular parameters, and fractal dimension were obtained. Further statistical analysis of the distribution pattern of each morphological characteristic parameter was carried out in a large sample to provide a basis for the quality control of coarse aggregates processing. What’s more, further statistical analysis of the distribution pattern of each morphological characteristic parameter was carried out in a large sample to provide a basis for the quality control of coarse aggregates processing. The axial coefficient of coarse aggregates of different particle sizes, decreases with increasing particle size. The roundness decreases with increasing particle size, and the fractal dimension decreases with increasing particle size; the axial coefficient and rectangularity can be used to characterize the shape of coarse aggregates without the influence of angles. Roughness and fractal dimension can be used to characterize coarse aggregate angles independent of shape; angular parameters, roughness or angular parameters, and fractal dimension can be chosen when characterizing angles only. This study can provide a fast and efficient quantitative basis for the optimization of the coarse aggregate processing and process control of incoming quality.","J. Ying, M. Ye, L. Tao, Z. Wu, Y.

34,Predicting CT Image From MRI Data Through Feature Matching With Learned Nonlinear Local Descriptors,"Attenuation correction for positron-emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) hybrid imaging systems and dose planning for MR-based radiation therapy remain challenging due to insufficient high-energy photon attenuation information. We present a novel approach that uses the learned nonlinear local descriptors and feature matching to predict pseudo computed tomography (pCT) images from T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The nonlinear local descriptors are obtained by projecting the linear descriptors into the nonlinear high-dimensional space using an explicit feature map and low-rank approximation with supervised manifold regularization. The nearest neighbors of each local descriptor in the input MR images are searched in a constrained spatial range of the MR images among the training dataset. Then the pCT patches are estimated through k-nearest neighbor regression. The proposed method for pCT prediction is quantitatively analyzed on a dataset consisting of paired brain MRI and CT images from 13 subjects. Our method generates pCT images with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 75.25 ± 18.05 Hounsfield units, a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 30.87 ± 1.15 dB, a relative MAE of 1.56 ± 0.5% in PET attenuation correction, and a dose relative structure volume difference of 0.055 ± 0.107% in D98%, as compared with true CT.

38,Comprehensive Comparison of Image Quality Aspects Between Conventional and Plane-Wave Imaging Methods on a Commercial Scanner,"Coherent plane-wave compound imaging (CPWCI) is used as alternative for conventional focused imaging (CFI) to increase frame rates linearly with the ratio number of imaging lines to steering angles. In this study, the image quality was compared between CPWCI and CFI, and the effect of steering angles (range and number) and beamforming strategies was evaluated in CPWCI. In automated breast volume scanners (ABVSs), which suffer from reduced volume rates, CPWCI might be an excellent candidate to replace CFI. Therefore, the image quality of CFI currently in ABVS and CPWCI was also compared in an in vivo breast lesion. Images were obtained by a Siemens Sequoia ultrasound system, and two transducers (14L5 and 10L4) in a CIRS multipurpose phantom (040GSE) and a breast lesion. Phantom results showed that contrast sensitivity and resolution, axial resolution, and generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR; imaging depths <45 mm) were similar for most imaging sequences. CNR (imaging depths ≥45 mm), penetration, and lateral resolution were significantly improved for CPWCI (15 angles) compared to CFI for both transducers. In CPWCI, certain combinations of steering angles and beamforming methods yielded improved gCNR (small angles and delay-and-sum) or lateral resolution (large angles and Lu’s-fk). Image quality seemed similar between CPWCI and CFI (three angles incoherent compounded as in ABVS) by visual inspection of the in vivo breast lesion images.",G. A. G. M.

When a model is designed to predict future-based on historical data using machine learning algorithms, data is vital because high quality data is needed to run the model efficiently and to predict highly accurate results. Machine learning algorithms receive data in many forms, like audio (speech recognition), images (feature recognition), numeric data (like height and weight) etc. When it comes to computer vision, the machine learning algorithms must be able to understand the image data, and before the images are processed to the algorithms it should be pre-processed (cleaned and set to the desired format) using various image pre-processing techniques.

45,Cross-Modality Image Adaptation Based on Volumetric Intensity Gaussian Process Models (VIGPM),"Image-based diagnosis routinely depends on more that one image modality for exploiting the complementary information they provide. However, it is not always possible to obtain images from a secondary modality for several reasons such as cost, degree of invasiveness and non-availability of scanners. Three-dimensional (3D) morphable models have made a significant contribution to the field of medical imaging for feature-based analysis. Here we extend their use to encode 3D volumetric imaging modalities. Specifically, we build a Gaussian Process (GP) over transformations establishing anatomical correspondence between training images within a modality. Given, two different modalities, the GP's eigenspace (latent space) can then be used to provide a parametric representation of each image modality, and we provide an operator for cross-domain translation between the two. We show that the latent space yields samples that are representative of the encoded modality. We also demonstrate that a 3D volumetric image can be efficiently encoded in latent space and transferred to synthesize the corresponding image in another modality. The framework called VIGPM can be extended by designing a fitting process to learn an observation in a given modality and performing cross-modality synthesis. Clinical Relevance— The proposed method provides a way to access a multi modality image from one modality. Both the source and synthetic modalities are in anatomical correspondence giving access to registered complementary information","N. H. Nbonsou Tegang, B. Borotikar, J. -R. Fouefack, V. Burdin and T.

48,Flexible Prediction of CT Images From MRI Data Through Improved Neighborhood Anchored Regression for PET Attenuation Correction,"Given the complicated relationship between the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals and the attenuation values, the attenuation correction in hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI systems remains a challenging task. Currently, existing methods are either time-consuming or require sufficient samples to train the models. In this paper, an efficient approach for predicting pseudo computed tomography (CT) images from T1- and T2-weighted MRI data with limited data is proposed. The proposed approach uses improved neighborhood anchored regression (INAR) as a baseline method to pre-calculate projected matrices to flexibly predict the pseudo CT patches. Techniques, including the augmentation of the MR/CT dataset, learning of the nonlinear descriptors of MR images, hierarchical search for nearest neighbors, data-driven optimization, and multi-regressor ensemble, are adopted to improve the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In total, 22 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. The pseudo CT images obtained using INAR with multi-regressor ensemble yielded mean absolute error (MAE) of 92.73 ± 14.86 HU, peak signal-to-noise ratio of 29.77 ± 1.63 dB, Pearson linear correlation coefficient of 0.82 ± 0.05, dice similarity coefficient of 0.81 ± 0.03, and the relative mean absolute error (rMAE) in PET attenuation correction of 1.30 ± 0.20% compared with true CT images. Moreover, our proposed INAR method, without any refinement strategies, can achieve considerable results with only seven subjects (MAE 106.89 ± 14.43 HU, rMAE 1.51 ± 0.21%). The experiments prove the superior performance of the proposed method over the six innovative methods. Moreover, the proposed method can rapidly generate the pseudo CT images that are suitable for PET attenuation correction.",L.

49,Review on Digital Image Processing Techniques for Face Recognition,"In the world of advancement, security is an important aspect of everyone's life. Personal data is easily accessed by hackers. This kind of problem can be reduced by using biometric access. Fingerprint, voice recognition, iris recognition, face recognition, and dental data is the few biometric techniques that provide end to end security between the user and service provider. Digital image processing plays a major role in this biometric recognition technique. Advancement in the digital image processing technique with the intellectual computer allows the researcher to work on this recognition technique. All recognition techniques have its merit and demerits. Face recognition is the most preferred technique which is not only providing secure access and also helpful to limit unauthorized access. Nowadays, social sites are using this technique to identify the user. If one photo is uploaded on the website immediately it matches the images with the database and helps the user to tag their friends. Advanced applications help the user by capturing their mood and play the songs, images, and so on. In this work, the basic image processing techniques to advance image processing techniques in face recognition are presented in a meaningful way.

50,Enumeration of Ampicillin-Resistant E. Coli in Blood Using Droplet Microfluidics and High-Speed Image Processing,"Bacteria entering the bloodstream causes bloodstream infection (BSI). Without proper treatment, BSI can lead to sepsis which is a life-threatening condition. Detection of bacteria in blood at the early stages of BSI can effectively prevent the development of sepsis. Using microfluidic droplets for single bacterium encapsulation provides single-digit bacterial detection sensitivity. In this study, samples of ampicillin-resistant E. coli in human blood were partitioned into millions of 30 μm diameter microfluidic droplets and followed by 8-hour culturing. Thousands of fluorescent bacteria from a single colony filled up the positive droplets after the culturing process. A circle detection software based on Hough Transform was developed to count the number of positive droplets from fluorescence images.

52,Implementation of Terahertz Video SAR Imaging Based on Multi-Core DSP,"Terahertz Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a microwave imaging radar capable of realizing modern high-resolution imaging all-day and all-weather. Terahertz SAR has a large amount of echo data and short pulse accumulation time. It is particularly difficult to realize terahertz video SAR imaging processing. To solve this problem, this paper deeply studies the terahertz SAR imaging algorithm and its hardware acceleration processing, and proposes a terahertz SAR imaging processing system based on multi-core digital signal processor. The system module mainly includes a parameter configuration module, a principle of chirp scaling processing module, an azimuth Sinc interpolation module and a sub-aperture self-focusing module. Firstly, the original echo data is imaged by polar format algorithm, and then the data is divided into several sub-aperture for self-focusing processing based on multiplexing extraction, and the focused image is output. Terahertz measured data show that the proposed imaging processing system can complete the image data processing of 2K×2K in the range and azimuth directions within 0.755s, and 5 high-quality SAR images of 1K×1K are finally output. The imaging rate reaches 5 frames per second which meets the requirements of video imaging.",Tao Wang; Daiyin Zhu; Xingwei Meng,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9886875,Image Processing,,,,terahertz synthet apertur radar sar microwav imag radar capabl realiz modern highresolut imag allday allweath terahertz sar larg amount echo data short puls accumul time particularli difficult realiz terahertz video sar imag process solv problem paper deepli studi terahertz sar imag algorithm hardwar acceler process propos terahertz sar imag process system base multicor digit signal processor system modul mainli includ paramet configur modul principl chirp scale process modul azimuth sinc interpol modul subapertur selffocus modul firstli origin echo data imag polar format algorithm data divid sever subapertur selffocus process base multiplex extract focus imag output terahertz measur data show propos imag process system complet imag data process 2k×2k rang azimuth direct within 0755 5 highqual sar imag 1k×1k final output imag rate reach 5 frame per second meet requir video imag,implement terahertz video sar imag base multicor dsp,implement terahertz video sar imag base multicor dsp terahertz synthet apertur radar sar microwav imag radar capabl realiz modern highresolut imag allday allweath terahertz sar larg amount echo data short puls accumul time particularli difficult realiz terahertz video sar imag process solv problem paper deepli studi terahertz sar imag algorithm hardwar acceler process propos terahertz sar imag process system base multicor digit signal processor system modul mainli includ paramet configur modul principl chirp scale process modul azimuth sinc interpol modul subapertur selffocus modul firstli origin echo data imag polar format algorithm data divid sever subapertur selffocus process base multiplex extract focus imag output terahertz measur data show propos imag process system complet imag data process 2k×2k rang azimuth direct within 0755 5 highqual sar imag 1k×1k final output imag rate reach 5 frame per second meet requir video imag
53,Joint Regularized-based Image Reconstruction by Combining Super-Resolution Sinogram for Computed Tomography Imaging,"In computed tomography imaging, the 2×2 acquisition mode improves the projection collection efficiency and reduces the X-ray exposure time; however, the collected projection is low-resolution and the reconstructed image quality is poor. Although the super-resolution (SR) method can improve the quality of the acquired projection in 2×2 acquisition mode, the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed image is still affected by the estimation errors between the SR sinograms and the high-resolution sinograms. In this study, a joint regularized-based reconstruction method was proposed. Under the condition of obtaining SR sinograms, we utilized the system matrix in 1×1 and 2×2 projection acquisition modes to construct the fidelity terms. In addition, the block matching and total variation regularizations were used to fully depict the sparsity of images. The proposed reconstruction model was solved by the iterative alternating minimization method. The experimental results on real anthropomorphic phantom data show that the proposed method is capable of suppressing noises while maintaining image details, which are not observed in the reconstructed results of other compared methods.",Chao Tang; Ailong Cai; Wenkun Zhang; Zhizhong Zheng; Ningning Liang; Lei Li,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9273488,Image Processing,,,,comput tomographi imag 2×2 acquisit mode improv project collect effici reduc xray exposur time howev collect project lowresolut reconstruct imag qualiti poor although superresolut sr method improv qualiti acquir project 2×2 acquisit mode signaltonois ratio reconstruct imag still affect estim error sr sinogram highresolut sinogram studi joint regularizedbas reconstruct method propos condit obtain sr sinogram util system matrix 1×1 2×2 project acquisit mode construct fidel term addit block match total variat regular use fulli depict sparsiti imag propos reconstruct model solv iter altern minim method experiment result real anthropomorph phantom data show propos method capabl suppress nois maintain imag detail observ reconstruct result compar method,joint regularizedbas imag reconstruct combin superresolut sinogram comput tomographi imag,joint regularizedbas imag reconstruct combin superresolut sinogram comput tomographi imag comput tomographi imag 2×2 acquisit mode improv project collect effici reduc xray exposur time howev collect project lowresolut reconstruct imag qualiti poor although superresolut sr method improv qualiti acquir project 2×2 acquisit mode signaltonois ratio reconstruct imag still affect estim error sr sinogram highresolut sinogram studi joint regularizedbas reconstruct method propos condit obtain sr sinogram util system matrix 1×1 2×2 project acquisit mode construct fidel term addit block match total variat regular use fulli depict sparsiti imag propos reconstruct model solv iter altern minim method experiment result real anthropomorph phantom data show propos method capabl suppress nois maintain imag detail observ reconstruct result compar method
54,A GPU-Based Two-Step Approach for High Resolution SAR Imaging,"The processing of high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data suffers from Doppler spectrum aliasing because the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the system is unable to cover the Doppler bandwidth of the signal. Besides, the enormous scale of high resolution SAR echo data will bring about heavy time cost on data processing under central processing unit (CPU), resulting in low processing efficiency. The graphics processing unit (GPU) can achieve massively parallel processing which is suitable for SAR data processing.

56,Microwave Medical Image Segmentation for Brain Stroke Diagnosis: Imaging-Process-Informed Image Processing,"In this paper, we propose a novel imaging-process-informed image segmentation method that accounts for uncertainty during the imaging process. A priori information is incorporated to enhance the contrast between stroke area and healthy tissues. The distorted Born iterative method (DBIM) is utilized to reconstruct the stroke area of the brain. Due to the non-linear relationship between actual and estimated dielectric constants resulting from DBIM, the microwave medical image lacks a clearly defined boundary, posing a challenge to accurately segment it using traditional methods. The proposed method achieves effective image segmentation by improving the traditional threshold method. From the simulation results, the region misclassified by the traditional method accounts for 89%, while the proposed method results in a misclassification rate of only 13%. The results demonstrate a significant improvement of 58.85% in accurately reproducing the dielectric constants.",Chenghui Liu; Zheng Gong; Yifan Chen; Shuaiting Yao,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10152073,Image Processing,,,,paper propos novel imagingprocessinform imag segment method account uncertainti imag process priori inform incorpor enhanc contrast stroke area healthi tissu distort born iter method dbim util reconstruct stroke area brain due nonlinear relationship actual estim dielectr constant result dbim microwav medic imag lack clearli defin boundari pose challeng accur segment use tradit method propos method achiev effect imag segment improv tradit threshold method simul result region misclassifi tradit method account 89 propos method result misclassif rate 13 result demonstr signific improv 5885 accur reproduc dielectr constant,microwav medic imag segment brain stroke diagnosi imagingprocessinform imag process,microwav medic imag segment brain stroke diagnosi imagingprocessinform imag process paper propos novel imagingprocessinform imag segment method account uncertainti imag process priori inform incorpor enhanc contrast stroke area healthi tissu distort born iter method dbim util reconstruct stroke area brain due nonlinear relationship actual estim dielectr constant result dbim microwav medic imag lack clearli defin boundari pose challeng accur segment use tradit method propos method achiev effect imag segment improv tradit threshold method simul result region misclassifi tradit method account 89 propos method result misclassif rate 13 result demonstr signific improv 5885 accur reproduc dielectr constant

59,Hotspot Detection of Solar Photovoltaic System: A Perspective from Image Processing,"Research in solar energy has rapidly grown since its significant and contributes to the advancement in clean renewable energy technology. Effective energy management such as fault detection impacts the early-stage monitoring for the efficiency, reliability, and safety of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The formation of a hotspot is one of the issues commonly occurred in a PV system. However, the main limitation of hotspot detection is the difficulty to interpret specific components with erratic temperatures in the thermographic images for attributes in the intelligence detection model. In this study, a review of hotspot detection in solar PV panels using the image processing method is established based on the image processing field. The integration of image processing approach can further assist in developing automated fault detection in solar PV farms for effective preventive monitoring methods.

60,Weakly Supervised Estimation of Shadow Confidence Maps in Fetal Ultrasound Imaging,"Detecting acoustic shadows in ultrasound images is important in many clinical and engineering applications. Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can guide sonographers to a standardized diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional information for other automatic image analysis algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions using learning-based algorithms is challenging because pixel-wise ground truth annotation of acoustic shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of acoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense shadow-focused confidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general shadow features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level annotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained binary shadow segmentation to a reference confidence map. In addition, a confidence estimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and the reference confidence maps. This network is able to predict shadow confidence maps directly from input images during inference. We use evaluation metrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation, and so on, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method is more consistent than human annotation and outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow segmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow confidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view image fusion, and automated biometric measurements.",Qingjie Meng; Matthew Sinclair; Veronika Zimmer; Benjamin Hou; Martin Rajchl; Nicolas Toussaint,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8698843,Image Processing,,,,detect acoust shadow ultrasound imag import mani clinic engin applic realtim feedback acoust shadow guid sonograph standard diagnost view plane minim artifact provid addit inform automat imag analysi algorithm howev automat detect shadow region use learningbas algorithm challeng pixelwis ground truth annot acoust shadow subject time consum paper propos weakli supervis method automat confid estim acoust shadow region method abl gener dens shadowfocus confid map method shadowseg modul built learn gener shadow featur shadow segment base global imagelevel annot well small number coars pixelwis shadow annot transfer function introduc extend obtain binari shadow segment refer confid map addit confid estim network propos learn map input imag refer confid map network abl predict shadow confid map directli input imag infer use evalu metric dice interclass correl verifi effect method method consist human annot outperform stateoftheart quantit shadow segment qualit confid estim shadow region furthermor demonstr applic method integr shadow confid map task ultrasound imag classif multiview imag fusion autom biometr measur,weakli supervis estim shadow confid map fetal ultrasound imag,weakli supervis estim shadow confid map fetal ultrasound imag detect acoust shadow ultrasound imag import mani clinic engin applic realtim feedback acoust shadow guid sonograph standard diagnost view plane minim artifact provid addit inform automat imag analysi algorithm howev automat detect shadow region use learningbas algorithm challeng pixelwis ground truth annot acoust shadow subject time consum paper propos weakli supervis method automat confid estim acoust shadow region method abl gener dens shadowfocus confid map method shadowseg modul built learn gener shadow featur shadow segment base global imagelevel annot well small number coars pixelwis shadow annot transfer function introduc extend obtain binari shadow segment refer confid map addit confid estim network propos learn map input imag refer confid map network abl predict shadow confid map directli input imag infer use evalu metric dice interclass correl verifi effect method method consist human annot outperform stateoftheart quantit shadow segment qualit confid estim shadow region furthermor demonstr applic method integr shadow confid map task ultrasound imag classif multiview imag fusion autom biometr measur

62,Quantitative evaluation of morphological characteristics of road coarse aggregates based on image processing technology,"To quantitatively characterize and evaluate the morphological features of coarse aggregate particles, 2D images of coarse aggregate particles were processed by using Image Pro-Plus software in this paper. Through image enhancement, correction, segmentation, and retrieval, six morphological indicators such as axial coefficient, rectangularity, roundness, roughness, angular parameters, and fractal dimension were obtained. Further statistical analysis of the distribution pattern of each morphological characteristic parameter was carried out in a large sample to provide a basis for the quality control of coarse aggregates processing. What’s more, further statistical analysis of the distribution pattern of each morphological characteristic parameter was carried out in a large sample to provide a basis for the quality control of coarse aggregates processing. The axial coefficient of coarse aggregates of different particle sizes, decreases with increasing particle size. The roundness decreases with increasing particle size, and the fractal dimension decreases with increasing particle size; the axial coefficient and rectangularity can be used to characterize the shape of coarse aggregates without the influence of angles. Roughness and fractal dimension can be used to characterize coarse aggregate angles independent of shape; angular parameters, roughness or angular parameters, and fractal dimension can be chosen when characterizing angles only. This study can provide a fast and efficient quantitative basis for the optimization of the coarse aggregate processing and process control of incoming quality.",Junzhi Ying; Min Ye; Li Tao; Zhihao Wu; Yunfei Zhao; Huimin Wang,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9777589,Image Processing,,,,quantit character evalu morpholog featur coars aggreg particl 2d imag coars aggreg particl process use imag proplu softwar paper imag enhanc correct segment retriev six morpholog indic axial coeffici rectangular round rough angular paramet fractal dimens obtain statist analysi distribut pattern morpholog characterist paramet carri larg sampl provid basi qualiti control coars aggreg process ’ statist analysi distribut pattern morpholog characterist paramet carri larg sampl provid basi qualiti control coars aggreg process axial coeffici coars aggreg differ particl size decreas increas particl size round decreas increas particl size fractal dimens decreas increas particl size axial coeffici rectangular use character shape coars aggreg without influenc angl rough fractal dimens use character coars aggreg angl independ shape angular paramet rough angular paramet fractal dimens chosen character angl studi provid fast effici quantit basi optim coars aggreg process process control incom qualiti,quantit evalu morpholog characterist road coars aggreg base imag process technolog,quantit evalu morpholog characterist road coars aggreg base imag process technolog quantit character evalu morpholog featur coars aggreg particl 2d imag coars aggreg particl process use imag proplu softwar paper imag enhanc correct segment retriev six morpholog indic axial coeffici rectangular round rough angular paramet fractal dimens obtain statist analysi distribut pattern morpholog characterist paramet carri larg sampl provid basi qualiti control coars aggreg process ’ statist analysi distribut pattern morpholog characterist paramet carri larg sampl provid basi qualiti control coars aggreg process axial coeffici coars aggreg differ particl size decreas increas particl size round decreas increas particl size fractal dimens decreas increas particl size axial coeffici rectangular use character shape coars aggreg without influenc angl rough fractal dimens use character coars aggreg angl independ shape angular paramet rough angular paramet fractal dimens chosen character angl studi provid fast effici quantit basi optim coars aggreg process process control incom qualiti
63,Modelling and Simulation of Smart Traffic Light System for Emergency Vehicle using Image Processing Techniques,"Saving time is very essential for humans. Every day people are spending some time at the traffic signal due to the drawbacks of the conventional traffic light system. In the existing traffic light system, a defined timer system is used and it is working based on preset timing. Due to the preset timing, there is no flexibility of ON/OFF in the signal light based on the emergency vehicle and congestion of the vehicle. Sometimes emergency vehicle like an ambulance needs to wait at a traffic signal for a long time and this would lead to a risk to a patient's life. Traffic police must personally identify an ambulance and release the congestion, but this is not possible as there are an enormous number of vehicles present these days. This project aims to providea solution for the issue in the conventional system. The model was designed using an image processing system that reads the image and determines the presence of an emergency vehicle and the density of vehicles in each lane the ON/OFF signal for the particular lane will be given to the traffic light system which helpsto reduce the unnecessary waiting time of vehicles. The system calculates the vehicle's density and to detect the emergency vehicle using image processing to provide the green light signal tothe lane.

65,Underwater Image Enhancement Algorithm Based on Logarithmic Transform Histogram Matching With Spatial Equalization,In this paper a novel algorithm is proposed for underwater image enhancement. The proposed method based on combined local and global image processing in the frequency domain. The basic idea is to apply logarithmic transform histogram matching with spatial equalization approach on different image blocks. The resulting image is a weighted mean of all processing blocks driven through optimization of measure of enhancement (EME). Some presented experimental results illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on real underwater images in comparison with the classical contrast enhancement techniques and adaptive histogram equalization techniques.,Viacheslav Voronin; Evgenii Semenishchev; Svetlana Tokareva; Alexander Zelenskiy; Sos Agaian,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8652298,Image Processing,,,,paper novel algorithm propos underwat imag enhanc propos method base combin local global imag process frequenc domain basic idea appli logarithm transform histogram match spatial equal approach differ imag block result imag weight mean process block driven optim measur enhanc eme present experiment result illustr perform propos algorithm real underwat imag comparison classic contrast enhanc techniqu adapt histogram equal techniqu,underwat imag enhanc algorithm base logarithm transform histogram match spatial equal,underwat imag enhanc algorithm base logarithm transform histogram match spatial equal paper novel algorithm propos underwat imag enhanc propos method base combin local global imag process frequenc domain basic idea appli logarithm transform histogram match spatial equal approach differ imag block result imag weight mean process block driven optim measur enhanc eme present experiment result illustr perform propos algorithm real underwat imag comparison classic contrast enhanc techniqu adapt histogram equal techniqu

67,Partial FOV Center Imaging (PCI): A Robust X-Space Image Reconstruction for Magnetic Particle Imaging,"Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality that images the spatial distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles using their nonlinear response to applied magnetic fields. In standard x-space approach to MPI, the image is reconstructed by gridding the speed-compensated nanoparticle signal to the instantaneous position of the field free point (FFP). However, due to safety limits on the drive field, the field-of-view (FOV) needs to be covered by multiple relatively small partial field-of-views (pFOVs). The image of the entire FOV is then pieced together from individually processed pFOVs. These processing steps can be sensitive to non-ideal signal conditions such as harmonic interference, noise, and relaxation effects. In this work, we propose a robust x-space reconstruction technique, Partial FOV Center Imaging (PCI), with substantially simplified pFOV processing. PCI first forms a raw image of the entire FOV by mapping MPI signal directly to pFOV center locations. The corresponding MPI image is then obtained by deconvolving this raw image by a compact kernel, whose fully-known shape solely depends on the pFOV size. We analyze the performance of the proposed reconstruction via extensive simulations, as well as imaging experiments on our in-house FFP MPI scanner. The results show that PCI offers a trade-off between noise robustness and interference robustness, outperforming standard x-space reconstruction in terms of both robustness against non-ideal signal conditions and image quality.",Semih Kurt; Yavuz Muslu; Emine Ulku Saritas,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9095326,Image Processing,,,,magnet particl imag mpi emerg medic imag modal imag spatial distribut superparamagnet iron oxid spio nanoparticl use nonlinear respons appli magnet field standard xspace approach mpi imag reconstruct grid speedcompens nanoparticl signal instantan posit field free point ffp howev due safeti limit drive field fieldofview fov need cover multipl rel small partial fieldofview pfov imag entir fov piec togeth individu process pfov process step sensit nonid signal condit harmon interfer nois relax effect work propos robust xspace reconstruct techniqu partial fov center imag pci substanti simplifi pfov process pci first form raw imag entir fov map mpi signal directli pfov center locat correspond mpi imag obtain deconvolv raw imag compact kernel whose fullyknown shape sole depend pfov size analyz perform propos reconstruct via extens simul well imag experi inhous ffp mpi scanner result show pci offer tradeoff nois robust interfer robust outperform standard xspace reconstruct term robust nonid signal condit imag qualiti,partial fov center imag pci robust xspace imag reconstruct magnet particl imag,partial fov center imag pci robust xspace imag reconstruct magnet particl imag magnet particl imag mpi emerg medic imag modal imag spatial distribut superparamagnet iron oxid spio nanoparticl use nonlinear respons appli magnet field standard xspace approach mpi imag reconstruct grid speedcompens nanoparticl signal instantan posit field free point ffp howev due safeti limit drive field fieldofview fov need cover multipl rel small partial fieldofview pfov imag entir fov piec togeth individu process pfov process step sensit nonid signal condit harmon interfer nois relax effect work propos robust xspace reconstruct techniqu partial fov center imag pci substanti simplifi pfov process pci first form raw imag entir fov map mpi signal directli pfov center locat correspond mpi imag obtain deconvolv raw imag compact kernel whose fullyknown shape sole depend pfov size analyz perform propos reconstruct via extens simul well imag experi inhous ffp mpi scanner result show pci offer tradeoff nois robust interfer robust outperform standard xspace reconstruct term robust nonid signal condit imag qualiti
68,Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging Using the Erythrocytes—Part II: Velocity Images,"Super-resolution ultrasound imaging using the erythrocytes (SURE) has recently been introduced. The method uses erythrocytes as targets instead of fragile microbubbles (MBs). The abundance of erythrocyte scatterers makes it possible to acquire SURE data in just a few seconds compared with several minutes in ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) using MBs. A high number of scatterers can reduce the acquisition time; however, the tracking of uncorrelated and high-density scatterers is quite challenging. This article hypothesizes that it is possible to detect and track erythrocytes as targets to obtain vascular flow images. A SURE tracking pipeline is used with modules for beamforming, recursive synthetic aperture (SA) imaging, motion estimation, echo canceling, peak detection, and recursive nearest-neighbor (NN) tracker. The SURE tracking pipeline is capable of distinguishing the flow direction and separating tubes of a simulated Field II phantom with 125–25- μ m wall-to-wall tube distances, as well as a 3-D printed hydrogel micr-flow phantom with 100–60- μ m wall-to-wall channel distances. The comparison of an in vivo SURE scan of a Sprague-Dawley rat kidney with ULM and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans with voxel sizes of 26.5 and 5 μ m demonstrated consistent findings. A microvascular structure composed of 16 vessels exhibited similarities across all imaging modalities. The flow direction and velocity profiles in the SURE scan were found to be concordant with those from ULM.",Mostafa Amin Naji; Iman Taghavi; Mikkel Schou; Sebastian Kazmarek PræSius; Lauge Naur Hansen; Nathalie Sarup Panduro,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552297,Image Processing,,,,superresolut ultrasound imag use erythrocyt sure recent introduc method use erythrocyt target instead fragil microbubbl mb abund erythrocyt scatter make possibl acquir sure data second compar sever minut ultrasound local microscopi ulm use mb high number scatter reduc acquisit time howev track uncorrel highdens scatter quit challeng articl hypothes possibl detect track erythrocyt target obtain vascular flow imag sure track pipelin use modul beamform recurs synthet apertur sa imag motion estim echo cancel peak detect recurs nearestneighbor nn tracker sure track pipelin capabl distinguish flow direct separ tube simul field ii phantom 125–25 μ walltowal tube distanc well 3d print hydrogel micrflow phantom 100–60 μ walltowal channel distanc comparison vivo sure scan spraguedawley rat kidney ulm microcomput tomographi ct scan voxel size 265 5 μ demonstr consist find microvascular structur compos 16 vessel exhibit similar across imag modal flow direct veloc profil sure scan found concord ulm,superresolut ultrasound imag use erythrocytes—part ii veloc imag,superresolut ultrasound imag use erythrocytes—part ii veloc imag superresolut ultrasound imag use erythrocyt sure recent introduc method use erythrocyt target instead fragil microbubbl mb abund erythrocyt scatter make possibl acquir sure data second compar sever minut ultrasound local microscopi ulm use mb high number scatter reduc acquisit time howev track uncorrel highdens scatter quit challeng articl hypothes possibl detect track erythrocyt target obtain vascular flow imag sure track pipelin use modul beamform recurs synthet apertur sa imag motion estim echo cancel peak detect recurs nearestneighbor nn tracker sure track pipelin capabl distinguish flow direct separ tube simul field ii phantom 125–25 μ walltowal tube distanc well 3d print hydrogel micrflow phantom 100–60 μ walltowal channel distanc comparison vivo sure scan spraguedawley rat kidney ulm microcomput tomographi ct scan voxel size 265 5 μ demonstr consist find microvascular structur compos 16 vessel exhibit similar across imag modal flow direct veloc profil sure scan found concord ulm

70,Simulation of Computer Image Processing Model Based on Random Forest Algorithm,"In essence, image recognition, as a pattern classification problem, can also be processed by classical pattern classification algorithms. Under the background of network information technology, it is need to use computer vision algorithm to process the image and realize the three-dimensional reconstruction of the image for the distortion of the true three-dimensional display image of intelligent interactive system. Random Forest (RF) is a new ensemble learning algorithm developed in recent years, which has good classification accuracy. In this article, a computer image processing model based on RF algorithm is proposed to enhance the ability of depth feature learning. The experimental results show that this image processing technology is more accurate than BP neural network and can be widely used in image processing. High-level target feature representation can often improve the recognition accuracy. However, the extraction of high-level target features generally has certain computational complexity. Compared with traditional methods, the accuracy of the proposed method is greatly improved, and the generalization performance is superior, which can identify images that have been beautified and repaired.",Haotian Liu,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229762,Image Processing,,,,essenc imag recognit pattern classif problem also process classic pattern classif algorithm background network inform technolog need use comput vision algorithm process imag realiz threedimension reconstruct imag distort true threedimension display imag intellig interact system random forest rf new ensembl learn algorithm develop recent year good classif accuraci articl comput imag process model base rf algorithm propos enhanc abil depth featur learn experiment result show imag process technolog accur bp neural network wide use imag process highlevel target featur represent often improv recognit accuraci howev extract highlevel target featur gener certain comput complex compar tradit method accuraci propos method greatli improv gener perform superior identifi imag beautifi repair,simul comput imag process model base random forest algorithm,simul comput imag process model base random forest algorithm essenc imag recognit pattern classif problem also process classic pattern classif algorithm background network inform technolog need use comput vision algorithm process imag realiz threedimension reconstruct imag distort true threedimension display imag intellig interact system random forest rf new ensembl learn algorithm develop recent year good classif accuraci articl comput imag process model base rf algorithm propos enhanc abil depth featur learn experiment result show imag process technolog accur bp neural network wide use imag process highlevel target featur represent often improv recognit accuraci howev extract highlevel target featur gener certain comput complex compar tradit method accuraci propos method greatli improv gener perform superior identifi imag beautifi repair
71,Detection of Megalopa Phase Crab Larvae Using Digital Image Processing,"Blue Swimmer Crab has high economic value as an export commodity. One of the problems that occur in crab culture is cannibalism during the larval development phase. Megalopa phase crab larvae tend to eat zoea phase crab larvae due to inadequate feeding. To avoid cannibalism in the crab larvae development phase, farmers need to check the development of larvae regularly and separate the megalopa phase crab larvae from zoea phase crab larvae. Checking is done by looking directly at the rearing tank, which is time-consuming and difficult because the phase changes in the crab larvae are unpredictable. This research focuses on the detection process of the megalopa phase crab larvae using a convolutional neural network (CNN) method.

74,"MimickNet, Mimicking Clinical Image Post- Processing Under Black-Box Constraints","Image post-processing is used in clinical-grade ultrasound scanners to improve image quality (e.g., reduce speckle noise and enhance contrast). These post-processing techniques vary across manufacturers and are generally kept proprietary, which presents a challenge for researchers looking to match current clinical-grade workflows. We introduce a deep learning framework, MimickNet, that transforms conventional delay-and-summed (DAS) beams into the approximate Dynamic Tissue Contrast Enhanced (DTCE™) post-processed images found on Siemens clinical-grade scanners. Training MimickNet only requires post-processed image samples from a scanner of interest without the need for explicit pairing to DAS data. This flexibility allows MimickNet to hypothetically approximate any manufacturer's post-processing without access to the pre-processed data. MimickNet post-processing achieves a 0.940 ± 0.018 structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) compared to clinical-grade post-processing on a 400 cine-loop test set, 0.937 ± 0.025 SSIM on a prospectively acquired dataset, and 0.928 ± 0.003 SSIM on an out-of-distribution cardiac cine-loop after gain adjustment. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish deep learning models that closely approximate ultrasound post-processing found in current medical practice. MimickNet serves as a clinical post-processing baseline for future works in ultrasound image formation to compare against. Additionally, it can be used as a pretrained model for fine-tuning towards different post-processing techniques. To this end, we have made the MimickNet software, phantom data, and permitted in vivo data open-source at https://github.com/ouwen/MimickNet.",Ouwen Huang; Will Long; Nick Bottenus; Marcelo Lerendegui; Gregg E.

Image processing methods are widely used in the field of remote sensing to extract the region of interest in the image.

This proposed approach is validated by comparing the actual and the thresholded image. The performance measures such as Mean Square error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), Peak Signal to Noise ratio(PSNR), Structural SIMilarity(SSIM), Normalized Absolute Error(NAE) are identified and they provide good values for the proposed work.

This feature is essential for digital art, computer graphics, virtual reality, and textile visualization since it improves visual realism and creative expression. Existing methods frequently use complicated machine learning and AI models, which can be computationally expensive and difficult to apply. To ensure efficient and precise texture transfer, we use fundamental image processing techniques such as color space transformations and luminance matching. Our solution achieves smooth texture integration by matching the brightness of a style card image to a target color card image and incorporating chrominance information.

Therefore, quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy in deeper tissue still remains a challenge. This paper presents a three dimensional blind image deconvolution method for fluorescence microscopy using 3way spatially constrained cycle-consistent adversarial networks. The restored volumes of the proposed deconvolution method and other well-known deconvolution methods, denoising methods, and an inhomogeneity correction method are visually and numerically evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can restore and improve the quality of blurred and noisy deep depth microscopy image visually and quantitatively.",Soonam Lee; Shuo Han; Paul Salama; Kenneth W.

79,Multi-Atlas Image Soft Segmentation via Computation of the Expected Label Value,"The use of multiple atlases is common in medical image segmentation. This typically requires deformable registration of the atlases (or the average atlas) to the new image, which is computationally expensive and susceptible to entrapment in local optima. We propose to instead consider the probability of all possible atlas-to-image transformations and compute the expected label value (ELV) , thereby not relying merely on the transformation deemed “optimal” by the registration method. Moreover, we do so without actually performing deformable registration, thus avoiding the associated computational costs. We evaluate our ELV computation approach by applying it to brain, liver, and pancreas segmentation on datasets of magnetic resonance and computed tomography images.",Iman Aganj; Bruce Fischl,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9373379,Image Processing,,,,use multipl atlas common medic imag segment typic requir deform registr atlas averag atla new imag comput expens suscept entrap local optima propos instead consid probabl possibl atlastoimag transform comput expect label valu elv therebi reli mere transform deem “ optim ” registr method moreov without actual perform deform registr thu avoid associ comput cost evalu elv comput approach appli brain liver pancrea segment dataset magnet reson comput tomographi imag,multiatla imag soft segment via comput expect label valu,multiatla imag soft segment via comput expect label valu use multipl atlas common medic imag segment typic requir deform registr atlas averag atla new imag comput expens suscept entrap local optima propos instead consid probabl possibl atlastoimag transform comput expect label valu elv therebi reli mere transform deem “ optim ” registr method moreov without actual perform deform registr thu avoid associ comput cost evalu elv comput approach appli brain liver pancrea segment dataset magnet reson comput tomographi imag

Photovoltaic (PV) is one of the alternative energy methods. The efficiency of PV systems is significantly affected by environmental factors such as temperature and panel pollution. It is important to identify adverse factors in improving the performance of PV systems. In this study, the determination of the contamination on the PV panels by using image processing techniques has been achieved. In the PV system, two identical panels were used, one of which was left to be contaminated naturally and the other was kept clean to be used for reference values.

82,Artillery Gun Recoil Measurement Using High-Speed Imaging and Image Processing Technique,"The recoil of an artillery gun system is the rearward movement of the ordnance on firing relative to the mounting or carriage. Recoil system is an assembly which is designed to control the recoil force acting on the gun by absorbing the recoil energy smoothly at a convenient distance and returning it back to the original position. It provides dynamic stability to the gun. Assessment of recoil system is of paramount importance during gun design phase trial. Recoil length and recoil velocity are the parameters help in assessing the recoil system. Traditionally recoil length is measured with the help of calibrated plate which is attached at the lower plate of the structure and a recoil velocity of an artillery gun is measured with the help of LVDT. These methods are contact-based methods. Here in this work, we have presented a non-contact, high-speed imaging based method to measure the recoil length and recoil velocity. In this method, two quadrant markers with known separation distance and diameter are pasted on the barrel before the firing. High-speed camera with proper optics is placed perpendicular to the ordinance at pre-calculated offset distance. The camera is calibrated with the help ofknown distance between two quadrant markers. Recoil phenomena are captured with the help of a high-speed camera which, in turn, is triggered by a flash detector. After firing, suitable image and video processing methods are used to process the acquired video of recoil phenomena and various recoil parameters are measured. In this work, we have provided the detail of experimental setup, calibration method and various image and video processing methods used for measuring the parameter. This method can be applied to small to high caliber artillery gun recoil system assessment.",Md M.

83,Learned Low-Rank Priors in Dynamic MR Imaging,"Deep learning methods have achieved attractive performance in dynamic MR cine imaging. However, most of these methods are driven only by the sparse prior of MR images, while the important low-rank (LR) prior of dynamic MR cine images is not explored, which may limit further improvements in dynamic MR reconstruction. In this paper, a learned singular value thresholding (Learned-SVT) operator is proposed to explore low-rank priors in dynamic MR imaging to obtain improved reconstruction results. In particular, we put forward a model-based unrolling sparse and low-rank network for dynamic MR imaging, dubbed as SLR-Net. SLR-Net is defined over a deep network flow graph, which is unrolled from the iterative procedures in the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a sparse and LR-based dynamic MRI model. Experimental results on a single-coil scenario show that the proposed SLR-Net can further improve the state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) methods and sparsity-driven deep learning-based methods with strong robustness to different undersampling patterns, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, SLR-Net has been extended to a multi-coil scenario, and achieved excellent reconstruction results compared with a sparsity-driven multi-coil deep learning-based method under a high acceleration. Prospective reconstruction results on an open real-time dataset further demonstrate the capability and flexibility of the proposed method on real-time scenarios.",Ziwen Ke; Wenqi Huang; Zhuo-Xu Cui; Jing Cheng; Sen Jia; Haifeng Wang,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9481108,Image Processing,,,,deep learn method achiev attract perform dynam mr cine imag howev method driven spars prior mr imag import lowrank lr prior dynam mr cine imag explor may limit improv dynam mr reconstruct paper learn singular valu threshold learnedsvt oper propos explor lowrank prior dynam mr imag obtain improv reconstruct result particular put forward modelbas unrol spars lowrank network dynam mr imag dub slrnet slrnet defin deep network flow graph unrol iter procedur iter shrinkagethreshold algorithm ista optim spars lrbase dynam mri model experiment result singlecoil scenario show propos slrnet improv stateoftheart compress sens cs method sparsitydriven deep learningbas method strong robust differ undersampl pattern qualit quantit besid slrnet extend multicoil scenario achiev excel reconstruct result compar sparsitydriven multicoil deep learningbas method high acceler prospect reconstruct result open realtim dataset demonstr capabl flexibl propos method realtim scenario,learn lowrank prior dynam mr imag,learn lowrank prior dynam mr imag deep learn method achiev attract perform dynam mr cine imag howev method driven spars prior mr imag import lowrank lr prior dynam mr cine imag explor may limit improv dynam mr reconstruct paper learn singular valu threshold learnedsvt oper propos explor lowrank prior dynam mr imag obtain improv reconstruct result particular put forward modelbas unrol spars lowrank network dynam mr imag dub slrnet slrnet defin deep network flow graph unrol iter procedur iter shrinkagethreshold algorithm ista optim spars lrbase dynam mri model experiment result singlecoil scenario show propos slrnet improv stateoftheart compress sens cs method sparsitydriven deep learningbas method strong robust differ undersampl pattern qualit quantit besid slrnet extend multicoil scenario achiev excel reconstruct result compar sparsitydriven multicoil deep learningbas method high acceler prospect reconstruct result open realtim dataset demonstr capabl flexibl propos method realtim scenario

88,Superiorized Photo-Acoustic Non-NEgative Reconstruction (SPANNER) for Clinical Photoacoustic Imaging,"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging can revolutionize medical ultrasound by augmenting it with molecular information. However, clinical translation of PA imaging remains a challenge due to the limited viewing angles and imaging depth. Described here is a new robust algorithm called Superiorized Photo-Acoustic Non-NEgative Reconstruction (SPANNER), designed to reconstruct PA images in real-time and to address the artifacts associated with limited viewing angles and imaging depth. The method utilizes precise forward modeling of the PA propagation and reception of signals while accounting for the effects of acoustic absorption, element size, shape, and sensitivity, as well as the transducer's impulse response and directivity pattern. A fast superiorized conjugate gradient algorithm is used for inversion. SPANNER is compared to three reconstruction algorithms: delay-and-sum (DAS), universal back-projection (UBP), and model-based reconstruction (MBR). All four algorithms are applied to both simulations and experimental data acquired from tissue-mimicking phantoms, ex vivo tissue samples, and in vivo imaging of the prostates in patients. Simulations and phantom experiments highlight the ability of SPANNER to improve contrast to background ratio by up to 20 dB compared to all other algorithms, as well as a 3-fold increase in axial resolution compared to DAS and UBP. Applying SPANNER on contrast-enhanced PA images acquired from prostate cancer patients yielded a statistically significant difference before and after contrast agent administration, while the other three image reconstruction methods did not, thus highlighting SPANNER's performance in differentiating intrinsic from extrinsic PA signals and its ability to quantify PA signals from the contrast agent more accurately.",Idan Steinberg; Jeesu Kim; Martin K.

89,Prediction of Abnormality in Pathology Tissue Images using Image Processing,"Micro spectroscopy based on vibration hyper spectral imaging (HSI) in the infrared band (mid-IR) is a powerful imaginative method of examining the chemical composition of substances, which can be used on tissue samples to diagnose disease. With the configuration of skin under cells and information from hundreds of central IR bands per pixel, modern HSI systems can be used to identify different cell types and subcellaneous cell components without using color markers or protein targeting. It is widely used in pathology. HSV (Hue saturation and value) is used to determine the tissue portion of an image. After the HSV split the image will be in the binary mask. Morphology in the context of image processing means a description of the shape and structure of the object in the image. The purpose of using morphological functions is to remove imperfections from image formation. Most of the functions used here are a combination of two processes, extension and erosion The separation process is used to determine the abnormality of the test image. Accuracy is up to 91.98%",V.

92,IMAGING: In-Memory AlGorithms for Image processiNG,"Data-intensive applications such as image processing suffer from massive data movement between memory and processing units. The severe limitations on system performance and energy efficiency imposed by this data movement are further exacerbated with any increase in the distance the data must travel. This data transfer and its associated obstacles could be eliminated by the use of emerging non-volatile resistive memory technologies (memristors) that make it possible to both store and process data within the same memory cells. In this paper, we propose four in-memory algorithms for efficient execution of fixed point multiplication using MAGIC gates. These algorithms achieve much better latency and throughput than a previous work and significantly reduce the area cost. They can thus be feasibly implemented inside the size-limited memory arrays.

93,Image processing based machine vision system for tomato volume estimation,"Fleshy fruits are an essential part of the human diet providing vital vitamins, minerals and other health-promoting compounds. The quality of ripe fruit (such as texture, color, shelf life, sugar content) has significant effect on influences consumer acceptance, resistance against pathogens and transportability to long distances. Tomato is one of most largely grown agricultural products in the world, therefore, it is essential to deliver the fruit in high quality manner. There is a need of determining the quality attributes of this fruit (non-destructively) by fast and cost-effective techniques without damage due to the increasing demand of the in agro- industrially controlled areas. Most of the commonly employed techniques are time consuming and involve a considerable degree of manual work. Sample collection, cutting, grading and laboratory tests are among the limitations. Visual appearance is the main source of information about quality. This work aims to estimate volume of tomato, variety grown in Turkey, by image processing techniques. Five different images of a tomato are captured using high resolution digital cameras. Volume of the fruit is computed by estimating horizontal and vertical distance of captured images. The results are validated with experimental results. The main purpose of this study is to make fast and cheap determination of the fruit quality evaluation process without damaging the fruit and making it ready for packaging.",Selman UluiŞik; Fikret Yildiz; Ahmet Turan Özdemİr,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8391460,Image Processing,,,,fleshi fruit essenti part human diet provid vital vitamin miner healthpromot compound qualiti ripe fruit textur color shelf life sugar content signific effect influenc consum accept resist pathogen transport long distanc tomato one larg grown agricultur product world therefor essenti deliv fruit high qualiti manner need determin qualiti attribut fruit nondestruct fast costeffect techniqu without damag due increas demand agro industri control area commonli employ techniqu time consum involv consider degre manual work sampl collect cut grade laboratori test among limit visual appear main sourc inform qualiti work aim estim volum tomato varieti grown turkey imag process techniqu five differ imag tomato captur use high resolut digit camera volum fruit comput estim horizont vertic distanc captur imag result valid experiment result main purpos studi make fast cheap determin fruit qualiti evalu process without damag fruit make readi packag,imag process base machin vision system tomato volum estim,imag process base machin vision system tomato volum estim fleshi fruit essenti part human diet provid vital vitamin miner healthpromot compound qualiti ripe fruit textur color shelf life sugar content signific effect influenc consum accept resist pathogen transport long distanc tomato one larg grown agricultur product world therefor essenti deliv fruit high qualiti manner need determin qualiti attribut fruit nondestruct fast costeffect techniqu without damag due increas demand agro industri control area commonli employ techniqu time consum involv consider degre manual work sampl collect cut grade laboratori test among limit visual appear main sourc inform qualiti work aim estim volum tomato varieti grown turkey imag process techniqu five differ imag tomato captur use high resolut digit camera volum fruit comput estim horizont vertic distanc captur imag result valid experiment result main purpos studi make fast cheap determin fruit qualiti evalu process without damag fruit make readi packag
94,Advanced Image Processing for Rapid Threat Object Identification in Terahertz Images,"With an increasing trend of anti-social activities and terrorist attacks, there is a persistent demand for rapid and effective security screening systems, particularly in crowded public places such as in metros stations, airports, etc. Nowadays, terahertz (THz) based rapid scanners and cameras are employed as an alternative to the traditional X-ray baggage scanners due to the ability of THz waves to penetrate most nonmetallic materials and low ionizing radiation. Although such rapid THz line scanners and cameras are commercially available, the quality of the THz images acquired with these devices are very poor. This requires advanced image processing techniques to be employed for rapid threat object detection and identification. In this work, a sequence of image processing steps has been adopted which include (i) Weiner filtering, (ii) Lucy-Richardson deconvolution with the appropriate point-spread function, (iii) histogram based global thresholding of the image. This sequence of image processing operations has resulted in refined images thereby enabling rapid threat object detection and identification. This approach may be utilized as a preprocessing step before implementing sophisticated neural networks for automatic threat object detection and classification.", Ashlesha Jagdale; A. S.

95,Tomato Plant Disease Detection Using Image Processing for Agriculture Application,"This research paper outlines a new method for detecting diseases in tomato plants using advanced image processing techniques. The proposed approach involves several steps, including capturing high-quality digital images of tomato plants with a camera and processing the images to improve their visual features. Once the diseased regions have been identified, a set of features are extracted from them using texture analysis and color- based features. These features provide a unique signature that can be used to distinguish between different types of diseases, such as early blight, late blight, and bacterial spot, with high accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated using a large dataset of tomato plant images with different types of diseases, and the results demonstrate that it can accurately identify and classify the diseases with high precision. By enabling early detection and identification of plant diseases, this method can help farmers prevent crop losses, reduce the use of harmful pesticides, and promote sustainable agriculture practices.",Bansilal Bairwa; Vivek Kumar; Zulqurnain Omar; Asif Sayed; Vishal Kumar,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577337,Image Processing,,,,research paper outlin new method detect diseas tomato plant use advanc imag process techniqu propos approach involv sever step includ captur highqual digit imag tomato plant camera process imag improv visual featur diseas region identifi set featur extract use textur analysi color base featur featur provid uniqu signatur use distinguish differ type diseas earli blight late blight bacteri spot high accuraci propos method evalu use larg dataset tomato plant imag differ type diseas result demonstr accur identifi classifi diseas high precis enabl earli detect identif plant diseas method help farmer prevent crop loss reduc use harm pesticid promot sustain agricultur practic,tomato plant diseas detect use imag process agricultur applic,tomato plant diseas detect use imag process agricultur applic research paper outlin new method detect diseas tomato plant use advanc imag process techniqu propos approach involv sever step includ captur highqual digit imag tomato plant camera process imag improv visual featur diseas region identifi set featur extract use textur analysi color base featur featur provid uniqu signatur use distinguish differ type diseas earli blight late blight bacteri spot high accuraci propos method evalu use larg dataset tomato plant imag differ type diseas result demonstr accur identifi classifi diseas high precis enabl earli detect identif plant diseas method help farmer prevent crop loss reduc use harm pesticid promot sustain agricultur practic
96,Design of Image Processing Tool Using MATLAB for Freshness Assessment of Beef and Pork,"Filipinos, regarding meat consumption are more than global average. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2017 study, an ordinary Filipino eat 14.2 kilograms of pork which is two kilogram above world's pork consumption yearly while 3 kilos when in terms of beef. In the 2019 forecast, the trend increases at 15.8 kilos for pork and 3.2 kilos for beef. Freshness is the state of being made recently or not having declined on meat or food specifically. Cherry Red is the ideal color for fresh beef, and it should be reddish pink for fresh pork. Color can clearly affect their safety when the consumer eats the spoiled meat or even hot meat. Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms for digital image processing. It is also used to manipulate images.

The proposed architecture supports any spatial image processing accelerator that maintains a simple handshaking protocol regardless of the latency of the accelerator. The design of the support platform allows rapid development of spatial image processing accelerators by isolating the complex task of managing the data transfers back and forth from the main memory. Multiple instances of the support platform were instantiated using two different edge detection accelerators at a core clock rate of 105 MHz for test purposes. The system was processing 1920x1080 pixel frames at a rate of 205 frames per second.

99,Hardware Parallel Processing of 3×3-pixel Image Kernels,"Video processing usually requires one to read in an entire image into a framebuffer, usually taking the form of random access memory (RAM). For kernel-based image and video processing, square-sized kernels are then extracted from this framebuffer, typically in 3×3-pixel sizes, though other sizes are also common. To meet the demand for ever higher image resolutions, larger and larger framebuffer RAM memories are required.While it is not feasible for software to read and process parts of an image quickly and efficiently enough due to the high speed of incoming video, a hardware-based video processing solution poses no such limitations. RAM-based framebuffers can also be found on hardware-based video processing systems, however such designs are not leveraging the full power and potential of processing image kernels with digital hardware. This paper introduces hardware techniques to read and process kernels without the need to store the entire image frame. This reduces the memory requirements significantly without loss of quality to the processed images.",Daniel C.K.

1,What Makes Research Software Sustainable? An Interview Study with Research Software Engineers,"Software is now a vital scientific instrument, providing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the humanities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent 'reinvention of the wheel'. Understanding how to develop sustainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers - the people actively developing software in an academic research environment - subjectively define software sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8816873,Software Engineering,,,"M.

2,"Software Engineering Education: Towards Ethical, Reliable, and Beautiful Software","In this paper, we present our experience with an innovative pedagogical approach to software engineering in a graduate-level advanced software engineering course. Our approach to software engineering and software design education relies on six dimensions: 1) restating the goal of software engineering education to say that software must be conceived of, architected, designed, developed, deployed, maintained, and managed to be ethical, reliable, and beautiful; 2) software should be engineered as a service; 3) apply proven architectural principles; 4) use sound design principles; 5) create rapid multi-modal prototyping; and 6) bring the course learning objectives together by creating a term-long project that creates a solution to a real-world problem using an iterative process. The results from students’ feedback have been very positive with students citing the benefits of the course particularly a) the realignment of software engineering education goals centered on creating ethical, reliable, and beautiful software, b) the focus on clean, sound, and efficient architectures, and c) blending of IEEE SWEBOK, modern microservice architectures, and emerging approaches from software engineering research and open source. We plan to continue developing the course and enhance it in the areas of software reuse, software product design, AI and software design, design for diverse users, and design for sustainability.CCS CONCEPTS •Software and its engineering~Software creation and management~Software development process management~Software development methods •Software and its engineering~Software organization and properties~Extra-functional properties~Software reliability •Software and its engineering~Software creation and management~Designing software~Software design engineering •Social and professional topics~Professional topics~Computing education~Computing education programs~Software engineering education •Applied computing~Education~Collaborative learning •Software and its engineering~Software creation and management~Software development techniques~Software prototyping •Software and its engineering~Software creation and management~Collaboration in software development~Programming",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669866,Software Engineering,,,"A.

3,Tutorial on a Gamification Toolset for Improving Engagement of Students in Software Engineering Courses,"Few if any would dispute that educating software engineering is a challenging endeavour. Although programming and creating new artefacts can motivate the creativity of students. Other software engineering topics (like e.g. requirement specifications and testing) are not considered very exciting by students. However, these topics are important to develop quality software and insufficient knowledge of students — Europe's future software engineers — in the long run contributes to failing software. The EU Erasmus+ project IMPRESS was set to explore the use of gamification in educating software engineering at the university level. The objective has been to develop a toolset that can help to improve students' engagement, and hence their appreciation, for the taught subjects like software testing and specifications.

4,"A Progression Model of Software Engineering Goals, Challenges, and Practices in Start-Ups","Context: Software start-ups are emerging as suppliers of innovation and software-intensive products. However, traditional software engineering practices are not evaluated in the context, nor adopted to goals and challenges of start-ups. As a result, there is insufficient support for software engineering in the start-up context. Objective: We aim to collect data related to engineering goals, challenges, and practices in start-up companies to ascertain trends and patterns characterizing engineering work in start-ups. Such data allows researchers to understand better how goals and challenges are related to practices. This understanding can then inform future studies aimed at designing solutions addressing those goals and challenges. Besides, these trends and patterns can be useful for practitioners to make more informed decisions in their engineering practice. Method: We use a case survey method to gather first-hand, in-depth experiences from a large sample of software start-ups. We use open coding and cross-case analysis to describe and identify patterns, and corroborate the findings with statistical analysis. Results: We analyze 84 start-up cases and identify 16 goals, 9 challenges, and 16 engineering practices that are common among start-ups. We have mapped these goals, challenges, and practices to start-up life-cycle stages (inception, stabilization, growth, and maturity). Thus, creating the progression model guiding software engineering efforts in start-ups. Conclusions: We conclude that start-ups to a large extent face the same challenges and use the same practices as established companies. However, the primary software engineering challenge in start-ups is to evolve multiple process areas at once, with a little margin for serious errors.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8643804,Software Engineering,,,E.

Hence, projects are an important part of software engineering curricula. As software engineering methods and technologies are only relevant for non-trivial software systems, we report in this paper on a master-level software engineering project course in which a team of students developed a compiler for the Game Boy in a single semester. The students developed different languages and corresponding parsers to a common intermediate language, optimizations on the intermediate language, as well as a code generator for the Game Boy.

7,Why Pakistani Software Companies don't use Best Practices for Requirement Engineering Processes,"Requirement engineering (RE) is initial and critical phase of software engineering. The success of software project is based on good requirement engineering practices. The purpose of requirement engineering practices is to elicit all intended user needs and document them for clarity of understanding and for future reference. In developing countries like Pakistan best RE practices are not fully used in software industry. In this study, major reasons for not using best RE practices are identified based on literature review of research work done related to RE in different countries. Literature review revealed that lack of knowledge of requirement engineering processes, lack of cost, lack of time are major factors behind not using RE practices in software development. A survey was conducted to base on factors identified to highlight major obstacles in way of using best requirement engineering practices in Pakistan. Survey results depicted the main issues are lack of budget, lack of time, lack of dedicated team and communication difficulties.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614913,Software Engineering,,,"I.

But, how do you determine whether to develop a complex fictional case, or a simple real-world project with a considerable amount of learning about the software lifecycle? How do you determine whether or not to develop a social project aimed at the community? In order to analyze project characteristics a framework was elaborated, based in a matrix with attributes found in different academic projects carried out over 10 years, and weighted according to certain criteria.

9,The Impact of Combining Storytelling with Lecture on Female Students in Software Engineering Education,"Software engineering courses are characterized by heavy theoretical and complex concepts that might be challenging to teach while keeping students engaged in the classroom, which might impact them from pursuing software engineering careers later. Software engineering is well known to be a male dominated field even though the first software engineer was a woman. Research has shown that storytelling can be used to improve students and teachers engagement in primary and secondary education. However, there is a lack of research on storytelling application and efficiency in higher education to teach complex concepts. This study explored the impact of combining a story with lecture on undergraduate female students in a software engineering course. We investigated the following hypothesis: Combining storytelling with lectures can improve the female students interest in software engineering. A questionnaire study has been conducted with 24 female undergraduate students in the classroom. Students had no prior knowledge on software engineering before the study. The questionnaire was designed to be simple to motivate students to participate in the study. It contained three questions to capture the interest of female students in pursuing a career in software engineering: prior to the lecture, after the lecture, and after the story. The results showed that the story incorporated in the lecture had great impact on female students perception about software engineering. Combining storytelling with software engineering lectures seems a promising tool to engage female students in higher education and increase their interest in pursuing a career in software engineering.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9453992,Software Engineering,,,S.

It also sets out open research challenges for the application of LLMs to technical problems faced by software engineers. LLMs' emergent properties bring novelty and creativity with applications right across the spectrum of Software Engineering activities including coding, design, requirements, repair, refactoring, performance improvement, documentation and analytics. However, these very same emergent properties also pose significant technical challenges; we need techniques that can reliably weed out incorrect solutions, such as hallucinations.

12,Are Computer Science and Engineering Graduates Ready for the Software Industry? Experiences from an Industrial Student Training Program,"It has been 50 years since the term ""software engineering"" was coined in 1968 at a NATO conference. The field should be relatively mature by now, with most established universities covering core software engineering topics in their Computer Science programs and others offering specialized degrees. However, still many practitioners lament a lack of skills in new software engineering hires. With the growing demand for software engineers from the industry, this apparent gap becomes more and more pronounced. One corporate strategy to address this gap is for the industry to develop supplementary training programs before the hiring process, which could also help companies screen viable candidates. In this paper, we report on our experiences and lessons learned in conducting a summer school program aimed at screening new graduates, introducing them to core skills relevant to the organization and industry, and assessing their attitudes toward mastering those skills before the hiring process begins. Our experience suggests that such initiatives can be mutually beneficial for new hires and companies alike. We support this insight with pre- and post-training data collected from the participants during the first edition of the summer school and a follow-up questionnaire conducted after a year with the participants, 50% of whom were hired by the company shortly after the summer school.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8445184,Software Engineering,,,"E.

13,Should Robotics Engineering Education Include Software Engineering Education?,"Multiple universities across the United States now offer bachelor's degrees in robotics, which aim to prepare students to work in the robotics industry. To judge how well these programs are providing software engineering training, we evaluate whether these programs teach the software engineering practices that are required for robotics software engineering. We compile an updated list of robotics bachelor's degree programs and measure whether the curriculum of each program claims to teach a specific practice. We find that some of these practices are not mentioned in the curricula, and that some are only taught implicitly in long-term project courses. These project courses vary in scope, guidance, and structure. This implies that robotics bachelor's degrees may not be preparing students to engage with the practices in the workforce.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9814834,Software Engineering,,,M.

14,Value Based Prioritization of Requirements in Software Engineering Education,"Both physical and software products have a functional use for which they were designed. Putting a new project idea into action necessitates a clear, holistic vision of the expected gain and costs. However, gain (or value) can have many different manifestations that often go far beyond pure functionality. For one thing, it can be about purely monetary value, but it can also be about expanding the company’s reach, improving customer loyalty, displacing competitors, or generating other additional benefits for the company or the user. Cost and Value Engineering is a promising approach for addressing such a value-centered perspective without losing sight of expenses. In typical Software Engineering courses Software Engineering students learn how to deal with requirements in general, as well as user stories, epics, and other requirements artifacts in the context of agile software development projects. However, aside from rudimentary planning activities for user stories or epics, they rarely learn to apply good value prioritization techniques. The primary goal of this paper is to present a validation experiment for two cost and value engineering methods in order to determine whether these methods are appropriate and valuable in a student context. The results are promising, indicating that these methods should be used in software engineering courses on a regular basis. In order for these methodologies to be properly incorporated into Software Engineering courses, an integrated tool support is required.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229428,Software Engineering,,,P.

David Parnas expressed that this “pithy phrase implies everything that differentiates software engineering from other programming” (Parnas, 2011). How does current software engineering research compare against this definition? Is there too much focus currently on research into problems and techniques more associated with programming than software engineering? Are there opportunities to use Randell's description of software engineering to guide the community to new research directions?

19,Secure Modules for Undergraduate Software Engineering Courses,"Security affects every software component in different types of computing systems. Many vulnerabilities and attacks on software systems are due to security weaknesses in the software itself. During the process of software specification, development, or testing, security issues are either taken into consideration insufficiently or not at all. Such software, due to internal weaknesses is prone to new attacks. By teaching secure software engineering techniques for designing and developing software modules, students would learn systematic secure software development techniques, such as defect detecting and security testing. This paper presents a series of modules that are designed to be integrated into undergraduate software engineering courses from a security perspective. The goal of the modules is to teach the building of robust software security requirements, secure software design and development, and secure software verification through a secure software development lifecycle.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8658433,Software Engineering,,,"J.

20,A Kind of 2-Stage Software Life Cycle and Cost Estimation Framework in Agile Methodology from a System Engineering Perspective,"Software cost estimate is essential not only for project plans but also for software budgeting. Many researchers research software engineering and software cost estimation from either software engineering or cost perspective. However, this non-systematic perspective or technology path leads to unnecessary conflicts both in academics and in engineering, such as Function Points Analysis treated as a financial or economic research method, software cost estimation treated only as a financial or economic tool, and software cost estimation treated as an unrelated tool to software development engineering. Software development disciplines have a direct and critical relationship to software cost estimation. This paper presents a basic 2-stage life cycle and related cost estimation framework, which illustrates cost structure and expresses in the equation to form a development-maintenance 2-stage module using agile. In this module, we assign software development to the first stage and combine software maintenance to the second stage. Under this framework, software development and cost estimation are connected.

22,Perceptions about Software Testing among UAE Software Students,"Software testing is one of the crucial supporting processes of software life cycle. Unfortunately for the software industry, the role is stigmatized, partly due to misperception and partly due to the treatment of the testing role within the software industry. The present study aims to analyse this situation to explore what might inhibit an individual from taking up a software testing career. In order to investigate this issue, we surveyed 132 senior students pursuing a degree in computer science and information and communication technology (ICT) related areas at three universities in the United Arab Emirates: UAE University in Al Ain, Sharjah University in Sharjah and New York University in Abu Dhabi. The students were asked to describe the PROs and CONs of taking up a career in software testing, and to describe the likelihood that they would take up the career themselves. The study identified 7 main PROs and 9 main CONs for pursuing a testing career, and indicated that the role of software tester is perceived as a social role, which may require as many soft skills as technical knowledge. The results also show that the UAE students have a stronger negative attitude towards software testing than do their counterparts where similar investigations have been carried out in different countries in the past three years.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9463267,Software Engineering,,,"L.

27,Dual-Track Agile in Software Engineering Education,"The fields of Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction have traditionally evolved in parallel, with little cross-pollination, both in industry and academia. However, effectively delivering software products offering superior user experiences requires a tight collaboration between professionals from both fields. In recent years, some approaches combining the two perspectives have been proposed in industry, including dual-track agile software development. Yet, very few courses cover those integrated approaches in academia, and it appears that no publication so far has reported the existence of a scholarly course covering dual-track agile. This paper introduces a course that addresses the divide between Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction through an integrated approach to requirements engineering and interaction design, in the context of dual-track agile. The course design combines traditional and flipped-classroom delivery, together with project-based learning. During the course project, students learn to design and implement software systems that address real problems and satisfy real stakeholders' needs by being useful, usable, and enjoyable to use. This paper documents the author's experience designing and teaching the course over the past four years. It aims to convince, inspire, and enable others to teach similar courses, bringing interaction design to the forefront of agile software development.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802105,Software Engineering,,,C.

28,Are You a Real Software Engineer? Best Practices in Online Recruitment for Software Engineering Studies,"Online research platforms, such as Prolific, offer rapid access to diverse participant pools but also pose unique challenges in participant qualification and skill verification. Previous studies reported mixed outcomes and challenges in leveraging online platforms for the recruitment of qualified software engineers. Drawing from our experience in conducting three different studies using Prolific, we propose best practices for recruiting and screening participants to enhance the quality and relevance of both qualitative and quantitative software engineering (SE) research samples. We propose refined best practices for recruitment in SE research on Prolific. (1) Iterative and controlled prescreening, enabling focused and manageable assessment of submissions (2) task-oriented and targeted questions that assess technical skills, knowledge of basic SE concepts, and professional engagement. (3) AI detection to verify the authenticity of free-text responses. (4) Qualitative and manual assessment of responses, ensuring authenticity and relevance in participant answers (5) Additional layers of prescreening are necessary when necessary to collect data relevant to the topic of the study. (6) Fair or generous compensation post-qualification to incentivize genuine participation. By sharing our experiences and lessons learned, we contribute to the development of effective and rigorous methods for SE empirical research. particularly the ongoing effort to estab-lish guidelines to ensure reliable data collection.

30,TABot: A Teaching Assistant Chatbot for Software Engineering Courses,"The Software Engineering (SE) course primarily teaches students how to develop and maintain high-quality software using systematic processes, methods, and tools. Five teaching issues in the SE course, including course breadth, limited teaching assistant resources, limited teaching interaction, learning weaknesses, and poor team communication, hinder students from absorbing technical concepts, knowledge, and skills for necessary subjects in the SE field. In recent years, Digital Interactive Learning has received increasing attention. Among them, Chatbot was significantly under the spotlight. It can confirm the user's intention by analyzing the content of the dialogue and simulating a human conversation. To address the teaching issues for the SE course and leverage the benefits brought by Chatbots, in this study, we designed a Chatbot system, called TABot, to assist teaching and learning, especially for the SE course. This study designed multiple features that support students' learning, such as frequently asked questions, requests for course materials, and adaptive quiz practices. Furthermore, TABot also provides team supporting functions, such as reading the user requirements of their team project, group member contribution analysis, and GitHub commit retrieval. After being applied to an SE course, 80% of the students agreed that TABot could help them learn better for the SE course.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10479374,Software Engineering,,,"S. -P.

One of the opportunities the survey data provided as a further study is to analyze the trajectory of 628 software practitioners, who completed their undergraduate degree in Turkey. We believe that such a study will help to characterize and understand the possible educational and career paths of Turkey-educated software practitioners working in different countries. With the help of such initial inputs, we hope that Turkish researchers will study more qualitative approaches to investigate the root causes of these phenomena by increasing more industry-academia collaborations (IACs).",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9247053,Software Engineering,,,D.

33,"“Software is the easy part of Software Engineering” - Lessons and Experiences from A Large-Scale, Multi-Team Capstone Course","Capstone courses in undergraduate software engineering are a critical final milestone for students. These courses allow students to create a software solution and demonstrate the knowledge they accumulated in their degrees. However, a typical capstone project team is small containing no more than 5 students and function independently from other teams. To better reflect real-world software development and meet industry demands, we introduce in this paper our novel capstone course. Each student was assigned to a large-scale, multi-team (i.e., company) of up to 20 students to collaboratively build software. Students placed in a company gained first-hand experiences with respect to multi-team coordination, integration, communication, agile, and teamwork to build a microservices based project. Furthermore, each company was required to implement plug-and-play so that their services would be compatible with another company, thereby sharing common APIs. Through developing the product in autonomous sub-teams, the students enhanced not only their technical abilities but also their soft skills such as communication and coordination. More importantly, experiencing the challenges that arose from the multi-team project trained students to realize the pitfalls and advantages of organizational culture. Among many lessons learned from this course experience, students learned the critical importance of building team trust. We provide detailed information about our course structure, lessons learned, and propose recommendations for other universities and programs. Our work concerns educators interested in launching similar capstone projects so that students in other institutions can reap the benefits of large-scale, multi-team development.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172647,Software Engineering,,,"Z.

34,Effective software refactoring process,"According to the plan-driven software development processes, software creation is comprised of a sequence of activities which starts with requirement analysis and continues with system design, implementation, testing and deployment and finally ends with maintenance phase. Although each phase contributes to the total development cost, research shows that more than 60% of it comes from maintenance. The quality and clarity of the system design or implementation subsequently is responsible for the cost of maintenance. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect and eliminate any design or implementation flaws to reduce the cost of development especially incurred by maintenance phase. This study discusses the importance of refactoring in software engineering and difficulties one may face with applying refactoring. We also lay out the factors that affect execution of certain refactoring. We present a discussion that takes us to a conceptual solution for more effective refactoring research and we share our observations and personal opinions in how to apply refactoring more effectively.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8355350,Software Engineering,,,"M.

35,Toward Formalizing The Emergent Behavior in Software Engineering,"The emergence phenomenon has been widely discussed in many fields such as: Biology, natural sciences, control theory, computer science... to name few. Different definitions and many attempts were made in order to shape one concrete definition that serves as a reference. In the midst of this struggle, we propose a new attempt to define the emergence phenomenon from a software engineering perspective. Whereas many fields study the phenomenon based on observation and report, software systems engineering includes the fact that we are not only observing but further participating in the creation of the system of interest, giving a different perspective in defining and understanding the phenomenon. In this paper, we propose both informal and formal definitions, discuss some characteristics and list categories of the emergent behavior and how can we harness such a behavior.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474625,Software Engineering,,,"T.

Decision makers are interested in mitigating any risks in the collaboration of specialists in different disciplines. This short positioning paper proposes an applied research approach to identify such risks for later mitigation.

37,A Research Perspective on Integrating Knowledge Management for Software Engineering,"The software development organizations strive to develop quality software to survive and gain competitive edge in the unpredictable competitive environment. However, common view regarding software development is that the projects are not accomplished in the due constraints of budget and time. In addition, the software delivered is low in quality. Software developers may carry out development of similar softwares from scratch without realizing that the fast and better quality softwares are developed by storing and reprocessing the knowledge of previously developed softwares. Hence, software engineering organizations must certainly adapt knowledge management practices for enhancing performance. This study explores the different perspectives of knowledge management in software engineering in the current literature and presents the future research prospects.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9702377,Software Engineering,,,M.

38,"A Survey on Blockchain Acquainted Software Requirements Engineering: Model, Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions","Requirements are the basis of software development practices. Ambiguities in requirements lead a project to a point of failure or penalize it with a high budget and time for defect traceability. The ever-growing demand for advanced computing systems has increased the complexity of Software Requirements Engineering (SRE) practices. Blockchain systems require specialized SRE practices as the issues of Requirement Traceability (RT), developer/client confidentiality, and Requirement Negotiation (RN) typically exist in conventional approaches, which require more improvement. Moreover, blockchain technology incorporates the capacity to function as an infrastructure for the SRE framework providing transparency, security, and reliability. Even though the significance of studying blockchain in the context of SRE is evident, it is still in its infancy. None of the previous studies surveyed this domain to the best of our knowledge. We aim to summarize the scholarly contributions of blockchain acquainted SRE from 2015 to 2021 and to provide academia and practitioners with in-depth knowledge about this domain. In this article, we have provided a novel comprehensive review of the aspects of blockchain-acquainted SRE practices. We have presented SRE-based quality improvement factors and outlined the need for blockchain technology in this domain. Furthermore, we have classified SRE practices based on blockchain engineering. In addition, we have proposed a generic SRE model built on blockchain infrastructure along with its workflows. Similarly, we have provided implementation guidelines for the future development guidance of SRE applications built on blockchain technology. Finally, we have presented the current research challenges and provided future directions based on blockchain acquainted SRE.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9765500,Software Engineering,,,"M.

43,Applying Human Values Theory to Software Engineering Practice: Lessons and Implications,"The study of human values in software engineering (SE) is increasingly recognised as a fundamental human-centric issue of SE decision making. However, values studies in SE still face a number of issues, including the difficulty of eliciting values in a systematic and structured way, the challenges of measuring and tracking values over time, and the lack of practice-based understanding of values among software practitioners. This paper aims to help address these issues by: 1) outlining a research framework that supports a systematic approach to values elicitation, analysis, and understanding; 2) introducing tools and techniques that help elicit and measure values during SE decision making processes in a systematic way; and 3) applying such tools to a month-long research sprint co-designed with an industry partner and conducted with 27 software practitioners. The case study builds on lessons from an earlier pilot (12 participants) and combines in-situ observations with the use of two values-informed tools: the Values Q-Sort (V-QS), and the Values-Retro. The V-QS adapts instruments from values research to the SE context, the Values-Retro adapts existing SE techniques to values theory.

44,Operationalizing Human Values in Software Engineering: A Survey,"Human values (e.g., pleasure, privacy, and social justice) are what a person or a society considers important. Inability to address them in software-intensive systems can result in numerous undesired consequences (e.g., financial losses) for individuals and communities. Various solutions (e.g., methodologies, techniques) are developed to help “operationalize values in software”. The ultimate goal is to ensure building software (better) reflects and respects human values. In this survey, “operationalizing values” is referred to as the process of identifying human values and translating them to accessible and concrete concepts so that they can be implemented, validated, verified, and measured in software . This paper provides a deep understanding of the research landscape on operationalizing values in software engineering, covering 51 primary studies. It also presents an analysis and taxonomy of 51 solutions for operationalizing values in software engineering. Our survey reveals that most solutions attempt to help operationalize values in the early phases (requirements and design) of the software development life cycle. However, the later phases (implementation and testing) and other aspects of software development (e.g., “team organization”) still need adequate consideration.

49,What is Discussed About Software Engineering Ethics on Stack Exchange (Q&A) Websites? A Case Study,"Software engineering ethics has been an interest of the software engineering community for over two decades, as evidenced by the creation of the joint ACM/IEEE-CS Soft-ware Engineering Code of Ethics. When reviewing the cur-rent software engineering literature, it was found that Stack Exchange question-and-answer (Q&A) websites are particularly good means of gaining a better understanding on a given subject: what topics are addressed within a subject area, the popularity of these topics, and the difficulty of these topics. As such, this paper utilizes Stack Exchange Q&A websites to review software engineering ethics and presents a case study that aims to provide a better understanding of the presence of software engineering ethics on three popular Stack Exchange Q&A websites, which are Stack Overflow (SO), Software Engineering (SE), and Project Management (PM). The study analyzes over 2,170 posts, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to better understand what ethic-related topics are discussed. Subsequently, the authors analyzed the popularity and difficulty of each identified topic. The study found that users discuss six ethic-related topics, which are as follows: web scraping, software quality, software security, open-source software usage, team and employers, and software billing. Moreover, the results revealed that software security is the most popular and the most difficult topic. This study highlights ethic-related challenges that are faced by Q&A website users.

50,Digitalization of Swedish Government Agencies - A Perspective Through the Lens of a Software Development Census,"Software engineering is at the core of the digitalization of society. Ill-informed decisions can have major consequences, as made evident in the 2017 government crisis in Sweden, originating in a data breach caused by an outsourcing deal made by the Swedish Transport Agency. Many Government Agencies (GovAgs) in Sweden are rapidly undergoing a digital transition, thus it is important to overview how widespread, and mature, software development is in this part of the public sector. We present a software development census of Swedish GovAgs, complemented by document analysis and a survey. We show that 39.2% of the GovAgs develop software internally, some matching the number of developers in large companies. Our findings suggest that the development largely resembles private sector counterparts, and that established best practices are implemented. Still, we identify improvement potential in the areas of strategic sourcing, openness, collaboration across GovAgs, and quality requirements. The Swedish Government has announced the establishment of a new digitalization agency next year, and our hope is that the software engineering community will contribute its expertise with a clear voice.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8445157/,Software Engineering,,,"M.

52,Supporting Software Engineering Research and Education by Annotating Public Videos of Developers Programming,"Software engineering has long studied how software developers work, building a body of work which forms the foundation of many software engineering best practices, tools, and theories. Recently, some developers have begun recording videos of themselves engaged in programming tasks contributing to open source projects, enabling them to share knowledge and socialize with other developers. We believe that these videos offer an important opportunity for both software engineering research and education. In this paper, we discuss the potential use of these videos as well as open questions for how to best enable this envisioned use. We propose creating a central repository of programming videos, enabling analyzing and annotating videos to illustrate specific behaviors of interest such as asking and answering questions, employing strategies, and software engineering theories. Such a repository would offer an important new way in which both software engineering researchers and students can understand how software developers work.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8817042,Software Engineering,,,Abdulaziz Alaboudi; Thomas D.

53,Benchmarking the software engineering undergraduate program curriculum at Jordan university of science and technology with the IEEE software engineering body of knowledge: (software engineering knowledge Areas #11-15),,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9798935,Software Engineering,,,"This paper evaluates the compliance of the software engineering undergraduate program (SWE-curriculum) at Jordan university of science and technology (JUST) with the last five of the fifteen software engineering knowledge Areas (SWE-KAs) of the SWEBOK-V3.0 of the IEEE computer Society. This research is the first to measure the coverage of the SWE-KAs in any SWE-curriculum. It is essential to line up the SWE-curriculum with the IEEE and IET views of software engineering (SWEBOK V3.0).This research attempted to answer questions such as: (a) what is the gap in the coverage of the SWE-KAs#11-15 topics across the SWE-curriculum? (b) what can be done to eliminate that gap? (c) What is the overall gap in the coverage of the SWE-KAs1-15 topics across the SWE-curriculum?This research was divided into three parts (P#1, P#2, and P#3). This paper focused on SWE-KAs#11-15. The previous two papers [1][2] focused on SWE-KA#1-5 and SWE-KA#6-10, respectively. The coverage of SWE-KAs#1-10 [1][2] was inspected across the SWE-curriculum courses. The results were identified as either fully compliant (the SWE-KA is fully covered across one or more of the SWE-curriculum courses); highly compliant (the SWE-KA is highly covered); or partially compliant (the SWE-KA is partially covered). Similarly, the coverage of SWE-KAs#11-15 (this paper, P#3) was inspected across the SWE-curriculum courses as well.The compliance was found fully compliant in the cases of the software requirements, software testing, software engineering management, and software quality software engineering knowledge areas. It was found highly compliant in the cases of the software design, software engineering models and methods, computing foundation, and mathematical foundation knowledge areas. It was found as partially compliant in the cases of the software construction, software maintenance, software configuration management, and software engineering process knowledge areas.

Therefore, depending on the Engineering career the Software Engineering course tend to be whether more technical. Thus, in some Engineering careers, students do not have a strong background to understand abstract concepts of Software Engineering.

56,Patch Management of Satellite Flight Software,"The satellite flight software is the software that enables the satellite to perform predefined tasks during its lifecycle and controls vital functions related to the satellite. For a satellite to perform its mission successfully, it must have the ability to correct errors found in its software while it is in orbit, with minimal disruption to mission operations. The solving of errors in the software is only possible via updates and when considering a satellite in orbit, the most practical method of updates is through patches. By means of patches, it is possible to add a new feature to the satellite flight software, to change an existing feature in the software or to fix the errors found in the software. However, considering the space domain, while patching the satellite flight software, there are constraints such as availability of the system, telemetry/telecommand bandwidth and the available memory dedicated to be used for patching. In line with the relevant constraints, solutions for minimizing the patch data size and finding different patching approaches must be considered. The aim of this study is to provide information about patching techniques and approaches considered to modify the satellite flight software through patches. Two approaches where the flight software or the bootloader is used for the patching process along with two different patch data generation techniques will be analyzed.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9659638,Software Engineering,,,Ezgi Kutlu; Camal Gençtürk; Renda Yiĝit; Feyza Nur Özcan,satellit flight softwar softwar enabl satellit perform predefin task lifecycl control vital function relat satellit satellit perform mission success must abil correct error found softwar orbit minim disrupt mission oper solv error softwar possibl via updat consid satellit orbit practic method updat patch mean patch possibl add new featur satellit flight softwar chang exist featur softwar fix error found softwar howev consid space domain patch satellit flight softwar constraint avail system telemetrytelecommand bandwidth avail memori dedic use patch line relev constraint solut minim patch data size find differ patch approach must consid aim studi provid inform patch techniqu approach consid modifi satellit flight softwar patch two approach flight softwar bootload use patch process along two differ patch data gener techniqu analyz,patch manag satellit flight softwar,patch manag satellit flight softwar satellit flight softwar softwar enabl satellit perform predefin task lifecycl control vital function relat satellit satellit perform mission success must abil correct error found softwar orbit minim disrupt mission oper solv error softwar possibl via updat consid satellit orbit practic method updat patch mean patch possibl add new featur satellit flight softwar chang exist featur softwar fix error found softwar howev consid space domain patch satellit flight softwar constraint avail system telemetrytelecommand bandwidth avail memori dedic use patch line relev constraint solut minim patch data size find differ patch approach must consid aim studi provid inform patch techniqu approach consid modifi satellit flight softwar patch two approach flight softwar bootload use patch process along two differ patch data gener techniqu analyz
57,Unreined Students or Not: Modes of Freedom in a Project-Based Software Engineering Course,"Software engineering courses include practical and theoretical elements that give many options for pedagogical combinations among them. In this paper, we report on two different pedagogical approaches for an undergraduate, introductory project-based software engineering course with more than 500 students working in collaborative scrum teams. We call one approach `Every Student is an Innovator', and the other `No Student Left Behind'. This SE course has been long-running, with stable learning objectives and content. However, from one year to another, we radically changed the pedagogical approach of the course along several dimensions, among them the technical framework, software tools, project topic, mentor roles, assessment form and frequency, feedback and degree of student innovativeness. We report on the perceived challenges, detailed changes, the anticipated effects on the course learning outcomes. The results showed that innovativeness and fun need freedom and flexibility with processes and technology. However, strict design requirements and systematic guidance ensure fulfillment of learning objectives. Analyzing student and staff feedback, we find that both approaches lead to students using more time than intended and worrying about unknown assessment criteria.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9206193,Software Engineering,,,Øystein Nytr⊘; Anh Nguyen-Duc; Hallvard Trætteberg; Madeleine Lorås; Babak Amin Farschian,softwar engin cours includ practic theoret element give mani option pedagog combin among paper report two differ pedagog approach undergradu introductori projectbas softwar engin cours 500 student work collabor scrum team call one approach everi student innov student left behind se cours longrun stabl learn object content howev one year anoth radic chang pedagog approach cours along sever dimens among technic framework softwar tool project topic mentor role assess form frequenc feedback degre student innov report perceiv challeng detail chang anticip effect cours learn outcom result show innov fun need freedom flexibl process technolog howev strict design requir systemat guidanc ensur fulfil learn object analyz student staff feedback find approach lead student use time intend worri unknown assess criteria,unrein student mode freedom projectbas softwar engin cours,unrein student mode freedom projectbas softwar engin cours softwar engin cours includ practic theoret element give mani option pedagog combin among paper report two differ pedagog approach undergradu introductori projectbas softwar engin cours 500 student work collabor scrum team call one approach everi student innov student left behind se cours longrun stabl learn object content howev one year anoth radic chang pedagog approach cours along sever dimens among technic framework softwar tool project topic mentor role assess form frequenc feedback degre student innov report perceiv challeng detail chang anticip effect cours learn outcom result show innov fun need freedom flexibl process technolog howev strict design requir systemat guidanc ensur fulfil learn object analyz student staff feedback find approach lead student use time intend worri unknown assess criteria
58,The Software Engineering Position Mapping From Personality Traits,"There are high demands of software engineering now a day due to the digital evolution. Having good software engineers to the team is an advantage for the business. There are many research indicates that there are relationships between software engineer position and personal traits. The work position requires people with specific traits to achieve work. So this paper proposed the K-question position mapping technique to find a suitable job position for the candidate. The candidate needs to complete the Five-Factor Model (FFM) test to explore their dominated traits. Using the model data from the FFM test of people with various positions, the dominated traits are compared to each traits data with software position. The proposed technique suggests the appropriate software position for the candidate. Besides, the proposed approach has been compared with other techniques such as regression analysis, and the k-nearest neighbor. The result shows that the proposed approach returns the appropriate position more accuracy than the other.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9090730,Software Engineering,,,Chartchai Doungsa-ard; Vipaporn Chaiwon,high demand softwar engin day due digit evolut good softwar engin team advantag busi mani research indic relationship softwar engin posit person trait work posit requir peopl specif trait achiev work paper propos kquestion posit map techniqu find suitabl job posit candid candid need complet fivefactor model ffm test explor domin trait use model data ffm test peopl variou posit domin trait compar trait data softwar posit propos techniqu suggest appropri softwar posit candid besid propos approach compar techniqu regress analysi knearest neighbor result show propos approach return appropri posit accuraci,softwar engin posit map person trait,softwar engin posit map person trait high demand softwar engin day due digit evolut good softwar engin team advantag busi mani research indic relationship softwar engin posit person trait work posit requir peopl specif trait achiev work paper propos kquestion posit map techniqu find suitabl job posit candid candid need complet fivefactor model ffm test explor domin trait use model data ffm test peopl variou posit domin trait compar trait data softwar posit propos techniqu suggest appropri softwar posit candid besid propos approach compar techniqu regress analysi knearest neighbor result show propos approach return appropri posit accuraci
59,A Project-Based Collaboration between Software Engineering and Criminology Students : Building Applications to Understand Racial Injustice in the Criminal Justice System,"Undergraduate software engineering courses typically require students to work on team-based projects that reinforce disciplinary content and soft skills. At the same time, these students, particularly those at liberal arts institutions, are required to take courses that focus on civic issues, including on racial and ethnic inequality. Often, students perceive these courses to be outside their disciplinary areas, and may not comprehend how these topics are applicable to computer science and software engineering. This paper reports on the experience of Pulimood and Leigey as they and their students grappled with issues of racial injustice in the criminal justice system, and drew upon their own disciplinary backgrounds to apply computational thinking and software engineering principles to help the community better understand these issues and advocate for reform. The paper also describes the experience of teaching courses from different disciplines in a collaborative model, working closely with a local community partner to support its work on an identified social issue, and the learning outcomes, as well as the benefits and challenges of this approach.

60,Myths and Facts about a Career in Software Testing: The Perspectives of Students and Practitioners,"Testing is an indispensable part of software development. However, a career in software testing is reported to be unpopular among technology students. This can potentially create a shortage of testers in the software industry in the future. The question is, whether the perception that undergraduate students have about software testing is accurate and whether it differs from the experience reported by those who work in testing activities in the software development industry. We obtained 63 answers from practitioners in the software industry, and previous surveys analyzed the perceptions of 648 students from software engineering. This investigation demonstrates that a career in software testing is more exciting and rewarding, as reported by professionals working in the field, than students may believe. Therefore, in order to guarantee a workforce focused on software quality, the academy and the software industry need to work together to better inform students about software testing and its essential role in software development.

61,Studies on the Software Testing Profession,"This paper attempts to understand motivators and de-motivators that influence the decisions of software professionals to take up and sustain software testing careers across four different countries, i.e. Canada, China, Cuba, and India. The research question can be framed as ""How many software professionals across different geographies are keen to take up testing careers, and what are the reasons for their choices?"" Towards that, we developed a cross-sectional but simple survey-based instrument. In this study we investigated how software testers perceived and valued what they do and their environmental settings. The study pointed out the importance of visualizing software testing activities as a set of human-dependent tasks and emphasized the need for research that examines critically individual assessments of software testers about software testing activities. This investigation can help global industry leaders to understand the impact of work-related factors on the motivation of testing professionals, as well as inform and support management and leadership in this context.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802688,Software Engineering,,,Luiz Fernando Capretz; Pradeep Waychal; Jingdong Jia; Daniel Varona; Yadira Lizama,paper attempt understand motiv demotiv influenc decis softwar profession take sustain softwar test career across four differ countri ie canada china cuba india research question frame mani softwar profession across differ geographi keen take test career reason choic toward develop crosssect simpl surveybas instrument studi investig softwar tester perceiv valu environment set studi point import visual softwar test activ set humandepend task emphas need research examin critic individu assess softwar tester softwar test activ investig help global industri leader understand impact workrel factor motiv test profession well inform support manag leadership context,studi softwar test profess,studi softwar test profess paper attempt understand motiv demotiv influenc decis softwar profession take sustain softwar test career across four differ countri ie canada china cuba india research question frame mani softwar profession across differ geographi keen take test career reason choic toward develop crosssect simpl surveybas instrument studi investig softwar tester perceiv valu environment set studi point import visual softwar test activ set humandepend task emphas need research examin critic individu assess softwar tester softwar test activ investig help global industri leader understand impact workrel factor motiv test profession well inform support manag leadership context

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has explored many aspects of software measurement. Throughout the history of software engineering, we have learned that software metrics for both the process and the product are needed. We have also explored many aspects of cybersecurity measurement and determined that we must be able to measure the processes for developing and using software and determine how those measurement results affect the resulting product’s cybersecurity.

63,Sketching with a Purpose: Moving from Supporting Modeling to Supporting Software Engineering Activities,"With the advent of large interactive displays and the increasing ubiquity of touch-enabled devices, digital sketching tools are becoming viable alternatives to classic whiteboards for the design and engineering of software systems. In this paper, we argue that current sketching tools still focus largely on creating sketches as artifacts (mostly, models), rather than recognizing sketches as byproducts of engineers' thought processes as they tackle a broad variety of complex engineering activities. We therefore advocate a more activity-than artifact-oriented view of sketching and propose research on a number of ways in which digital sketching can support cognitively demanding software engineering activities more directly.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8445545,Software Engineering,,,Matthias Book; André van der Hoek,advent larg interact display increas ubiqu touchen devic digit sketch tool becom viabl altern classic whiteboard design engin softwar system paper argu current sketch tool still focu larg creat sketch artifact mostli model rather recogn sketch byproduct engin thought process tackl broad varieti complex engin activ therefor advoc activitythan artifactori view sketch propos research number way digit sketch support cognit demand softwar engin activ directli,sketch purpos move support model support softwar engin activ,sketch purpos move support model support softwar engin activ advent larg interact display increas ubiqu touchen devic digit sketch tool becom viabl altern classic whiteboard design engin softwar system paper argu current sketch tool still focu larg creat sketch artifact mostli model rather recogn sketch byproduct engin thought process tackl broad varieti complex engin activ therefor advoc activitythan artifactori view sketch propos research number way digit sketch support cognit demand softwar engin activ directli

65,The Role of Software Trust in Selection of Open-Source and Closed Software,"Software selection is a critical part of any software engineering project, as projects depend on a rich ecosystem of components and frameworks. Software engineers always find it challenging to select a trustworthy software product despite the availability of a large number of software selection tools. This study explores the trust factors in open-source and closed software selection from a practitioner’s perspective, to gain insight into perceptions of software trust. To this aim, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 software practitioners from different businesses, including 12 experts in open-source software selection and 12 experts in closed software selection. By summarizing we found: (1) software selection is affected by three categories of factors, being technical, organizational, and structural assurance factors; (2) the most important factors are technical factors and organizational factors; and (3) software selection process and trust factors differ depending on the project risk tolerance. In addition, we compared the trust factors derived from the interviews with those found in the literature.

67,Google Scholar vs. Dblp vs. Microsoft Academic Search: An Indexing Comparison for Software Engineering Literature,"Background: One of the necessary conditions for any substantial research work is to synthesis the depth and the breath of the existing published literature on that topic. It is, thus, of extreme importance for a researcher to understand and look for both credible and exhaustive information sources. This first (important) step can be made significantly easier if the researcher can employ a more systematic way to extract the maximum of the literature on the topic. Objective: Essentially, the objective of this preliminary study is to rank three freely available academic search engines (Google Scholar, DBLP, Microsoft Academic Search) on the basis of the indexed Software Engineering academic literature they contain.

68,Current and Future Bots in Software Development,"Bots that support software development (""DevBots"") are seen as a promising approach to deal with the ever-increasing complexity of modern software engineering and development. Existing DevBots are already able to relieve developers from routine tasks such as building project images or keeping dependencies up-to-date. However, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence hold the promise of future, significantly more advanced, DevBots. In this paper, we introduce the terminology of contemporary and ideal DevBots. Contemporary DevBots represent the current state of practice, which we characterise using a facet-based taxonomy. We exemplify this taxonomy using 11 existing, industrial-strength bots. We further provide a vision and definition of future (ideal) DevBots, which are not only autonomous, but also adaptive, as well as technically and socially competent. These properties may allow ideal DevBots to act more akin to artificial team mates than simple development tools.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8823643,Software Engineering,,,Linda Erlenhov; Francisco Gomes de Oliveira Neto; Riccardo Scandariato; Philipp Leitner,bot support softwar develop devbot seen promis approach deal everincreas complex modern softwar engin develop exist devbot alreadi abl reliev develop routin task build project imag keep depend uptod howev advanc machin learn artifici intellig hold promis futur significantli advanc devbot paper introduc terminolog contemporari ideal devbot contemporari devbot repres current state practic characteris use facetbas taxonomi exemplifi taxonomi use 11 exist industrialstrength bot provid vision definit futur ideal devbot autonom also adapt well technic social compet properti may allow ideal devbot act akin artifici team mate simpl develop tool,current futur bot softwar develop,current futur bot softwar develop bot support softwar develop devbot seen promis approach deal everincreas complex modern softwar engin develop exist devbot alreadi abl reliev develop routin task build project imag keep depend uptod howev advanc machin learn artifici intellig hold promis futur significantli advanc devbot paper introduc terminolog contemporari ideal devbot contemporari devbot repres current state practic characteris use facetbas taxonomi exemplifi taxonomi use 11 exist industrialstrength bot provid vision definit futur ideal devbot autonom also adapt well technic social compet properti may allow ideal devbot act akin artifici team mate simpl develop tool
69,Human Values in Software Engineering: Contrasting Case Studies of Practice,"The growing diffusion of software in society and its influence on people demands from its creators that their work carefully considers human values such as transparency, social responsibility, and equality. But how do software practitioners address human values in software engineering practice? We interviewed 31 software practitioners from two organizations, each having a strong values framework, with the aim to understand: (a) practitioners’ perceptions of human values and their role in software engineering; (b) practices that practitioners use to address human values in software; and (c) challenges they face during this process. We report our findings from two contrasting case organizations on how practitioners “engineer” values in their unique organizational settings. We found evidence that organizational culture significantly contributes to how values are addressed in software.

70,Measuring Team Members’ Contributions in Software Engineering Projects using Git-driven Technology,"Software engineering is inherently a human-centric and collaborative process and this reflects in its teaching programs, as most of the courses comprise projects and team efforts. In order to fairly evaluate students, there is the problem of quantifying the amount of work contributed to the team development project by each of its members. Most commonly, in order to estimates student contributions, instructors use arbitrary and subjective judgment derived from observations and evaluations. The currently used process is not a complete picture and is time consuming since it requires numerous observations and extensive paperwork's review. Emerging decentralized systems (such as git) and their widespread applications in all realms of development which capitalize on team-aware metrics, are worthwhile and can provide a solution to the problem. In this work we support a solution that utilizes git-driven technology, and its related features, to measure a team member's contributions objectively, based not only upon the completion of the project, but also at any time during progression development. Such performance assessment could generate more productive team-based learning with higher-quality graduates for better meeting software industry's expectations.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8658983,Software Engineering,,,Reza M.

71,Industry Voices on Software Engineering Challenges in Cyber-Physical Production Systems Engineering,"Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) are envisioned as next-generation adaptive production systems combining modern production techniques with the latest information technology. A CPPS creates a complex environment between different domains (mechanical, electrical, software engineering), requiring multidisciplinary solutions to tackle growing complexity issues and reduce (maintenance) effort. Software plays an increasingly important role in assuring an effective and efficient operation of CPPSs. However, software engineering methods applied for CPPSs seem to lag behind modern software engineering methods, where tremendous progress has been made in the last years. We initiated the Software Engineering in Cyber-Physical Production Systems Workshop (SECPPS-WS) to analyze and overcome this gap. After two instances with mostly academic participants, we conducted a full-day workshop with nine industry representatives from eight companies that develop and maintain CPPSs. Each industry representative presented their current work and challenges. We collected these challenges and condensed a categorized list of challenges backed by industry statements and literature.

Digitalization, as a fundamental change in society and the economy, offers great opportunities for sustainable development, but also poses its own threats, as evident in the immense resource consumption and growing surveillance tendencies. To leverage digitalization for sustainability transformation without compromising it, software engineering requires a significant shift in practices and structures.

74,Quantum Software Engineering Challenges from Developers' Perspective: Mapping Research Challenges to the Proposed Workflow Model,"Despite the increasing interest in quantum computing, the aspect of development to achieve cost-effective and reliable quantum software applications has been slow. One barrier is the software engineering of quantum programs, which can be approached from two directions. On the one hand, many software engineering practices, debugging in particular, are bound to classical computing. On the other hand, quantum programming is closely associated with the phenomena of quantum physics, and consequently, the way we express programs resembles the early days of programming. Moreover, much of the software engineering research today focuses on agile development, where computing cycles are cheap and new software can be rapidly deployed and tested, whereas in the quantum context, executions may consume lots of energy, and test runs may require lots of work to interpret. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap by starting with the quantum computing workflow and by mapping existing software engineering research to this workflow. Based on the mapping, we then identify directions for software engineering research for quantum computing.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313635,Software Engineering,,,Majid Haghparast; Tommi Mikkonen; Jukka K.

However, today, data used to engineer software can have inherent biases (e.g. gender identity) with inclusiveness concerns. While much attention has been given to this topic in the AI/ML space, in this paper, we examine another data-centric software engineering process, A/B testing, for which we have a dearth of understanding today. Using real-world data from the Windows out of box experience (OOBE) feature, we provide a case-study of how inclusiveness concerns can manifest in A/B testing, practical adjustments to A/B testing towards inclusive software engineering, and insights into ongoing challenges.

78,Software Engineering Education: Challenges and Perspectives,"The software engineering community celebrated, in 2018, the 50th anniversary of what is considered to be the official start of the profession of software engineering. Software engineering is a young and promising discipline which is still under development and improvement. This is reflected when teaching software engineering in higher education. The aim of this study is to investigate the challenges and perspectives of software engineering education. To do so, a questionnaire study was conducted. 21 software engineering faculty and experts in teaching software engineering related courses participated in this study. The questionnaire contained demographic questions, questions related to students’ engagement and to different methodologies adopted by respondents in the classroom. Results showed that the majority of respondents found engaging students in software engineering courses to be the biggest challenge they faced in the classroom. Almost half of the participants found difficulties designing practical activities for students. Results also revealed that the problem-based learning approach is the most used in software engineering lectures, followed by gamification techniques and role-playing which are new trends used to engage students. Moreover, the majority of the participants considered that the adoption of new teaching methodologies in the classroom produced high impact in the students’ learning experience. Based on the outcomes of this questionnaire study, a conceptual model to engage students in software engineering courses is proposed.

80,Assessing the Quality of Low-Code and Model-Driven Engineering Platforms for Engineering IoT Systems,"Over the last few years, industry and academia have proposed several Low-Code and Model-driven Engineering (MDE) platforms to ease the engineering process of the Internet of things (IoT) systems. However, deciding whether such engineering platforms meet the minimum required software quality standards is not straightforward. Software quality can be defined as the degree to which a software system achieves its intended goal. Various software quality standards have been established to aid in the software quality assessment process; however, due to the nature of engineering IoT platforms, such models may not entirely suit the IoT domain. This paper presents a model for assessing the software quality of Low-Code and MDE platforms for engineering IoT platforms. The proposed software quality model is based on and extends the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 software product quality model standard. It is intended to assist IoT practitioners in assessing and establishing quality requirements for engineering IoT platforms.

81,Perceptions about Software Testing among UAE Software Students,"Software testing is one of the crucial supporting processes of software life cycle. Unfortunately for the software industry, the role is stigmatized, partly due to misperception and partly due to the treatment of the testing role within the software industry. The present study aims to analyse this situation to explore what might inhibit an individual from taking up a software testing career. In order to investigate this issue, we surveyed 132 senior students pursuing a degree in computer science and information and communication technology (ICT) related areas at three universities in the United Arab Emirates: UAE University in Al Ain, Sharjah University in Sharjah and New York University in Abu Dhabi. The students were asked to describe the PROs and CONs of taking up a career in software testing, and to describe the likelihood that they would take up the career themselves. The study identified 7 main PROs and 9 main CONs for pursuing a testing career, and indicated that the role of software tester is perceived as a social role, which may require as many soft skills as technical knowledge. The results also show that the UAE students have a stronger negative attitude towards software testing than do their counterparts where similar investigations have been carried out in different countries in the past three years.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9463267,Software Engineering,,,Luiz Fernando Capretz; Ali Bou Nassif; Saad Harous,softwar test one crucial support process softwar life cycl unfortun softwar industri role stigmat partli due mispercept partli due treatment test role within softwar industri present studi aim analys situat explor might inhibit individu take softwar test career order investig issu survey 132 senior student pursu degre comput scienc inform commun technolog ict relat area three univers unit arab emir uae univers al sharjah univers sharjah new york univers abu dhabi student ask describ pro con take career softwar test describ likelihood would take career studi identifi 7 main pro 9 main con pursu test career indic role softwar tester perceiv social role may requir mani soft skill technic knowledg result also show uae student stronger neg attitud toward softwar test counterpart similar investig carri differ countri past three year,percept softwar test among uae softwar student,percept softwar test among uae softwar student softwar test one crucial support process softwar life cycl unfortun softwar industri role stigmat partli due mispercept partli due treatment test role within softwar industri present studi aim analys situat explor might inhibit individu take softwar test career order investig issu survey 132 senior student pursu degre comput scienc inform commun technolog ict relat area three univers unit arab emir uae univers al sharjah univers sharjah new york univers abu dhabi student ask describ pro con take career softwar test describ likelihood would take career studi identifi 7 main pro 9 main con pursu test career indic role softwar tester perceiv social role may requir mani soft skill technic knowledg result also show uae student stronger neg attitud toward softwar test counterpart similar investig carri differ countri past three year

85,Analysis of Software Engineering for Agile Machine Learning Projects,"The number of machine learning, artificial intelligence or data science related software engineering projects using Agile methodology is increasing. However, there are very few studies on how such projects work in practice. In this paper, we analyze project issues tracking data taken from Scrum (a popular tool for Agile) for several machine learning projects. We compare this data with corresponding data from non-machine learning projects, in an attempt to analyze how machine learning projects are executed differently from normal software engineering projects. On analysis, we find that machine learning project issues use different kinds of words to describe issues, have higher number of exploratory or research oriented tasks as compared to implementation tasks, and have a higher number of issues in the product backlog after each sprint, denoting that it is more difficult to estimate the duration of machine learning project related tasks in advance. After analyzing this data, we propose a few ways in which Agile machine learning projects can be better logged and executed, given their differences with normal software engineering projects.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8987154,Software Engineering,,,Kushal Singla; Joy Bose; Chetan Naik,number machin learn artifici intellig data scienc relat softwar engin project use agil methodolog increas howev studi project work practic paper analyz project issu track data taken scrum popular tool agil sever machin learn project compar data correspond data nonmachin learn project attempt analyz machin learn project execut differ normal softwar engin project analysi find machin learn project issu use differ kind word describ issu higher number exploratori research orient task compar implement task higher number issu product backlog sprint denot difficult estim durat machin learn project relat task advanc analyz data propos way agil machin learn project better log execut given differ normal softwar engin project,analysi softwar engin agil machin learn project,analysi softwar engin agil machin learn project number machin learn artifici intellig data scienc relat softwar engin project use agil methodolog increas howev studi project work practic paper analyz project issu track data taken scrum popular tool agil sever machin learn project compar data correspond data nonmachin learn project attempt analyz machin learn project execut differ normal softwar engin project analysi find machin learn project issu use differ kind word describ issu higher number exploratori research orient task compar implement task higher number issu product backlog sprint denot difficult estim durat machin learn project relat task advanc analyz data propos way agil machin learn project better log execut given differ normal softwar engin project

87,Are You a Real Software Engineer? Best Practices in Online Recruitment for Software Engineering Studies,"Online research platforms, such as Prolific, offer rapid access to diverse participant pools but also pose unique challenges in participant qualification and skill verification. Previous studies reported mixed outcomes and challenges in leveraging online platforms for the recruitment of qualified software engineers. Drawing from our experience in conducting three different studies using Prolific, we propose best practices for recruiting and screening participants to enhance the quality and relevance of both qualitative and quantitative software engineering (SE) research samples. We propose refined best practices for recruitment in SE research on Prolific. (1) Iterative and controlled prescreening, enabling focused and manageable assessment of submissions (2) task-oriented and targeted questions that assess technical skills, knowledge of basic SE concepts, and professional engagement. (3) AI detection to verify the authenticity of free-text responses. (4) Qualitative and manual assessment of responses, ensuring authenticity and relevance in participant answers (5) Additional layers of prescreening are necessary when necessary to collect data relevant to the topic of the study. (6) Fair or generous compensation post-qualification to incentivize genuine participation. By sharing our experiences and lessons learned, we contribute to the development of effective and rigorous methods for SE empirical research. particularly the ongoing effort to estab-lish guidelines to ensure reliable data collection.

88,Dual-Track Agile in Software Engineering Education,"The fields of Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction have traditionally evolved in parallel, with little cross-pollination, both in industry and academia. However, effectively delivering software products offering superior user experiences requires a tight collaboration between professionals from both fields. In recent years, some approaches combining the two perspectives have been proposed in industry, including dual-track agile software development. Yet, very few courses cover those integrated approaches in academia, and it appears that no publication so far has reported the existence of a scholarly course covering dual-track agile. This paper introduces a course that addresses the divide between Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction through an integrated approach to requirements engineering and interaction design, in the context of dual-track agile. The course design combines traditional and flipped-classroom delivery, together with project-based learning. During the course project, students learn to design and implement software systems that address real problems and satisfy real stakeholders' needs by being useful, usable, and enjoyable to use. This paper documents the author's experience designing and teaching the course over the past four years. It aims to convince, inspire, and enable others to teach similar courses, bringing interaction design to the forefront of agile software development.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802105,Software Engineering,,,Cécile Péraire,field softwar engin humancomput interact tradit evolv parallel littl crosspollin industri academia howev effect deliv softwar product offer superior user experi requir tight collabor profession field recent year approach combin two perspect propos industri includ dualtrack agil softwar develop yet cours cover integr approach academia appear public far report exist scholarli cours cover dualtrack agil paper introduc cours address divid softwar engin humancomput interact integr approach requir engin interact design context dualtrack agil cours design combin tradit flippedclassroom deliveri togeth projectbas learn cours project student learn design implement softwar system address real problem satisfi real stakehold need use usabl enjoy use paper document author experi design teach cours past four year aim convinc inspir enabl other teach similar cours bring interact design forefront agil softwar develop,dualtrack agil softwar engin educ,dualtrack agil softwar engin educ field softwar engin humancomput interact tradit evolv parallel littl crosspollin industri academia howev effect deliv softwar product offer superior user experi requir tight collabor profession field recent year approach combin two perspect propos industri includ dualtrack agil softwar develop yet cours cover integr approach academia appear public far report exist scholarli cours cover dualtrack agil paper introduc cours address divid softwar engin humancomput interact integr approach requir engin interact design context dualtrack agil cours design combin tradit flippedclassroom deliveri togeth projectbas learn cours project student learn design implement softwar system address real problem satisfi real stakehold need use usabl enjoy use paper document author experi design teach cours past four year aim convinc inspir enabl other teach similar cours bring interact design forefront agil softwar develop
89,TABot: A Teaching Assistant Chatbot for Software Engineering Courses,"The Software Engineering (SE) course primarily teaches students how to develop and maintain high-quality software using systematic processes, methods, and tools. Five teaching issues in the SE course, including course breadth, limited teaching assistant resources, limited teaching interaction, learning weaknesses, and poor team communication, hinder students from absorbing technical concepts, knowledge, and skills for necessary subjects in the SE field. In recent years, Digital Interactive Learning has received increasing attention. Among them, Chatbot was significantly under the spotlight. It can confirm the user's intention by analyzing the content of the dialogue and simulating a human conversation. To address the teaching issues for the SE course and leverage the benefits brought by Chatbots, in this study, we designed a Chatbot system, called TABot, to assist teaching and learning, especially for the SE course. This study designed multiple features that support students' learning, such as frequently asked questions, requests for course materials, and adaptive quiz practices. Furthermore, TABot also provides team supporting functions, such as reading the user requirements of their team project, group member contribution analysis, and GitHub commit retrieval. After being applied to an SE course, 80% of the students agreed that TABot could help them learn better for the SE course.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10479374,Software Engineering,,,Shang-Pin Ma; Yan-Cih Liang; Sheng-Kai Wang; Yu-Wen Huang; Wan-Lin You,softwar engin se cours primarili teach student develop maintain highqual softwar use systemat process method tool five teach issu se cours includ cours breadth limit teach assist resourc limit teach interact learn weak poor team commun hinder student absorb technic concept knowledg skill necessari subject se field recent year digit interact learn receiv increas attent among chatbot significantli spotlight confirm user intent analyz content dialogu simul human convers address teach issu se cours leverag benefit brought chatbot studi design chatbot system call tabot assist teach learn especi se cours studi design multipl featur support student learn frequent ask question request cours materi adapt quiz practic furthermor tabot also provid team support function read user requir team project group member contribut analysi github commit retriev appli se cours 80 student agre tabot could help learn better se cours,tabot teach assist chatbot softwar engin cours,tabot teach assist chatbot softwar engin cours softwar engin se cours primarili teach student develop maintain highqual softwar use systemat process method tool five teach issu se cours includ cours breadth limit teach assist resourc limit teach interact learn weak poor team commun hinder student absorb technic concept knowledg skill necessari subject se field recent year digit interact learn receiv increas attent among chatbot significantli spotlight confirm user intent analyz content dialogu simul human convers address teach issu se cours leverag benefit brought chatbot studi design chatbot system call tabot assist teach learn especi se cours studi design multipl featur support student learn frequent ask question request cours materi adapt quiz practic furthermor tabot also provid team support function read user requir team project group member contribut analysi github commit retriev appli se cours 80 student agre tabot could help learn better se cours
90,Intensity of Misconception in Software Engineering,"""Misunderstanding is generally simpler than true understanding, and hence has more potential for popularity."" - Raheel Farooq. Misconception can be a great distortion to someone's carrier. The misconception of believing that software engineers can troubleshoot personal computing problems motivated the implementation of the research. The research is aimed at finding out the severity of misconception in Software Engineering field. Fifty-one voluntary software engineering students from year 1, 2 and 3 participated in the research. The data were fetched using questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS statistical application.

92,"“Software is the easy part of Software Engineering” - Lessons and Experiences from A Large-Scale, Multi-Team Capstone Course","Capstone courses in undergraduate software engineering are a critical final milestone for students. These courses allow students to create a software solution and demonstrate the knowledge they accumulated in their degrees. However, a typical capstone project team is small containing no more than 5 students and function independently from other teams. To better reflect real-world software development and meet industry demands, we introduce in this paper our novel capstone course. Each student was assigned to a large-scale, multi-team (i.e., company) of up to 20 students to collaboratively build software. Students placed in a company gained first-hand experiences with respect to multi-team coordination, integration, communication, agile, and teamwork to build a microservices based project. Furthermore, each company was required to implement plug-and-play so that their services would be compatible with another company, thereby sharing common APIs. Through developing the product in autonomous sub-teams, the students enhanced not only their technical abilities but also their soft skills such as communication and coordination. More importantly, experiencing the challenges that arose from the multi-team project trained students to realize the pitfalls and advantages of organizational culture. Among many lessons learned from this course experience, students learned the critical importance of building team trust. We provide detailed information about our course structure, lessons learned, and propose recommendations for other universities and programs. Our work concerns educators interested in launching similar capstone projects so that students in other institutions can reap the benefits of large-scale, multi-team development.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172647,Software Engineering,,,Ze Shi Li; Nowshin Nawar Arony; Kezia Devathasan; Daniela Damian,capston cours undergradu softwar engin critic final mileston student cours allow student creat softwar solut demonstr knowledg accumul degre howev typic capston project team small contain 5 student function independ team better reflect realworld softwar develop meet industri demand introduc paper novel capston cours student assign largescal multiteam ie compani 20 student collabor build softwar student place compani gain firsthand experi respect multiteam coordin integr commun agil teamwork build microservic base project furthermor compani requir implement plugandplay servic would compat anoth compani therebi share common api develop product autonom subteam student enhanc technic abil also soft skill commun coordin importantli experienc challeng aros multiteam project train student realiz pitfal advantag organiz cultur among mani lesson learn cours experi student learn critic import build team trust provid detail inform cours structur lesson learn propos recommend univers program work concern educ interest launch similar capston project student institut reap benefit largescal multiteam develop,“ softwar easi part softwar engin ” lesson experi largescal multiteam capston cours,“ softwar easi part softwar engin ” lesson experi largescal multiteam capston cours capston cours undergradu softwar engin critic final mileston student cours allow student creat softwar solut demonstr knowledg accumul degre howev typic capston project team small contain 5 student function independ team better reflect realworld softwar develop meet industri demand introduc paper novel capston cours student assign largescal multiteam ie compani 20 student collabor build softwar student place compani gain firsthand experi respect multiteam coordin integr commun agil teamwork build microservic base project furthermor compani requir implement plugandplay servic would compat anoth compani therebi share common api develop product autonom subteam student enhanc technic abil also soft skill commun coordin importantli experienc challeng aros multiteam project train student realiz pitfal advantag organiz cultur among mani lesson learn cours experi student learn critic import build team trust provid detail inform cours structur lesson learn propos recommend univers program work concern educ interest launch similar capston project student institut reap benefit largescal multiteam develop
93,Effective software refactoring process,"According to the plan-driven software development processes, software creation is comprised of a sequence of activities which starts with requirement analysis and continues with system design, implementation, testing and deployment and finally ends with maintenance phase. Although each phase contributes to the total development cost, research shows that more than 60% of it comes from maintenance. The quality and clarity of the system design or implementation subsequently is responsible for the cost of maintenance. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect and eliminate any design or implementation flaws to reduce the cost of development especially incurred by maintenance phase. This study discusses the importance of refactoring in software engineering and difficulties one may face with applying refactoring. We also lay out the factors that affect execution of certain refactoring. We present a discussion that takes us to a conceptual solution for more effective refactoring research and we share our observations and personal opinions in how to apply refactoring more effectively.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8355350,Software Engineering,,,Mehmet Kaya; Shannon Conley; Zhala S.

94,Toward Formalizing The Emergent Behavior in Software Engineering,"The emergence phenomenon has been widely discussed in many fields such as: Biology, natural sciences, control theory, computer science... to name few. Different definitions and many attempts were made in order to shape one concrete definition that serves as a reference. In the midst of this struggle, we propose a new attempt to define the emergence phenomenon from a software engineering perspective. Whereas many fields study the phenomenon based on observation and report, software systems engineering includes the fact that we are not only observing but further participating in the creation of the system of interest, giving a different perspective in defining and understanding the phenomenon. In this paper, we propose both informal and formal definitions, discuss some characteristics and list categories of the emergent behavior and how can we harness such a behavior.",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474625,Software Engineering,,,Toufik Mohamed Ailane; Mohammad Abboush; Christoph Knieke; Abram Lawendy; Andreas Rausch,emerg phenomenon wide discuss mani field biolog natur scienc control theori comput scienc name differ definit mani attempt made order shape one concret definit serv refer midst struggl propos new attempt defin emerg phenomenon softwar engin perspect wherea mani field studi phenomenon base observ report softwar system engin includ fact observ particip creation system interest give differ perspect defin understand phenomenon paper propos inform formal definit discuss characterist list categori emerg behavior har behavior,toward formal emerg behavior softwar engin,toward formal emerg behavior softwar engin emerg phenomenon wide discuss mani field biolog natur scienc control theori comput scienc name differ definit mani attempt made order shape one concret definit serv refer midst struggl propos new attempt defin emerg phenomenon softwar engin perspect wherea mani field studi phenomenon base observ report softwar system engin includ fact observ particip creation system interest give differ perspect defin understand phenomenon paper propos inform formal definit discuss characterist list categori emerg behavior har behavior

96,Collaborative Model-Driven Software Engineering: A Classification Framework and a Research Map,"Context: Collaborative Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) consists of methods and techniques where multiple stakeholders manage, collaborate, and are aware of each others' work on shared models. Objective: Collaborative MDSE is attracting research efforts from different areas, resulting in a variegated scientific body of knowledge. This study aims at identifying, classifying, and understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches. Method: We designed and conducted a systematic mapping study. Starting from over 3,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure resulting in 106 selected papers, further clustered into 48 primary studies along a time span of 19 years. We rigorously defined and applied a classification framework and extracted key information from each selected study for subsequent analysis. Results: Our analysis revealed the following main fidings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest on collaborative MDSE in the last years; (ii) multi-view modeling, validation support, reuse, and branching are more rarely covered with respect to other aspects about collaborative MDSE; (iii) different primary studies focus differently on individual dimensions of collaborative MDSE (i.e., model management, collaboration, and communication); (iv) most approaches are language-specific, with a prominence of UML-based approaches; (v) few approaches support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. Conclusion: This study gives a solid foundation for classifying existing and future approaches for collaborative MDSE.

1,Automatic Generation of Input Data for Distribution System Simulation Programs,"Computers have become quite fast, and therefore, the most time-consuming process in distribution system simulations is, in fact, the preparation of input data cases for the simulation programs. Considering this fact, we have developed a computer system which automatically generates input data cases for various distribution system simulation programs from a distribution facility database owned by a utility company. The distribution system simulation programs include a voltage analysis program, an electromagnetic transient analysis program, a harmonics analysis program, a lightning outage risk assessment program and an earthquake and storm (typhoon) risk assessment program. The planning, operation and troubleshooting of a distribution system nowadays are highly dependent on these simulation programs. Using the developed system, a distribution engineer can automatically prepare a simulation data case by specifying a feeder, a transformer bank or an area to be analyzed, and then she/he is readily able to start the simulation. The developed system is also effective to avoid human errors in the data preparation process.","T. Tadokoro, T. Noda, K. Ishimoto, N. Okada, S. Uemura and Y.

2,An Updated Review on Distribution Management Systems within a Smart Grid Structure,"A distribution management system is known as the core part of the operation process of an electrical power distribution grid. This system integrates all the aspects needed to have a reliable and consistent control of a distribution system. A typical distribution management system consists of some major components that in this paper are introduced as the operation, planning, power market, and ancillary sections. These subsystems interact with each other to implement all the tasks needed to manage the distribution system. Within an advanced distribution management system, the operation process of the whole system is structured to work under an almost real-time scale; the automation performance level of such system is enhanced meaningfully, and it uses the advanced version of analysis and optimization functions as well as applications.","S.

3,Comparative Multi-objective Investigation of Radial and Ring Distribution System in the Presence of DGs,"Power distribution systems must have the potential to satisfy the needs of their customers, such as high reliability, low power loss, acceptable voltage profile, and exploitation of Distributed Generators (DGs). The distribution grids, generally, are operated in a radial mode in rural areas. Hence, there is one current direction in the radial systems; however, DGs lead to a bi-directional current. Additionally, the radial system has another limitation regarding the reliability of the system. Therefore, there is a need to change radial ones into ring distribution systems to optimize DGs’ integrated capacity. In this paper, a redial distribution system is introduced, and afterward, the optimal ring distribution system by utilizing closed Circuit Breakers (CBs), which had been normally open, is implemented. The proposed method is effectively have been tested, and it enables ring distributed systems in the presence of DGs to have high reliability, low power loss, and acceptable voltage profile. The radial IEEE 33-bus system and a real 41 bus system have been evaluated, and in some cases, the benchmark system converted to a ring system with connecting DGs. In the end, the comparison of distribution systems has been investigated.","N. Deyhimi, H. Torkaman, M. Shadaei, M. Shabanirad and M.

4,A primary and secondary equipment integrated intelligent distribution system breaker to better locate and isolate faults,"As electrification deepens and the society relies more and more on electricity, dependability and safety standard of the power distribution system becomes higher and higher. What’s more, to minimize carbon emission, high percentage of renewable energy resources penetration is becoming a reality, which further complicates the distribution system. Because of equipment failure, animal intrusion and other causes, power system faults are inevitable. Fault section identification, location and isolation is a critical mission in distribution system operation [1]. As the distribution system develops and evolves, two main ways to accomplish this goal were established in distribution system: a) Substation overcurrent relay detects the fault and the corresponding substation breaker isolates the fault Then trial-and-error method is used to identify and isolate the fault section; b) Distributed sensors are deployed in the distribution system. Distribution system automation software in the operation center then collects fault information sent from all the distributed sensors. Operation stuff make a judgement on the fault section and fault isolation is done on a remote control or manual operation fashion.These methods leave a lot of room for improvements, which will be elaborated in the paper. A primary and secondary equipment integrated intelligent distribution system breaker is proposed, depending on which the shortcomings of the aforementioned methods can be overcome. This integrated breaker acquires and analyzes traveling wave signals and fundamental frequency signals, and then locate and isolate faults based on fault analysis results under various scenarios, including renewable energy resources integration. With this breaker, fault location accuracy and fault isolation selectivity and speed can be improved, which helps with distribution system reliability, safety, and economic operation.","L. Haitao, H.

5,Situational Awareness of De-energized Lines During Loss of SCADA Communication in Electric Power Distribution Systems,"With the electric power distribution grid facing ever increasing complexity and new threats from cyber-attacks, situational awareness for system operators is quickly becoming indispensable. Identifying de-energized lines on the distribution system during a SCADA communication failure is a prime example where operators need to act quickly to deal with an emergent loss of service. Loss of cellular towers, poor signal strength, and even cyber-attacks can impact SCADA visibility of line devices on the distribution system. Neural Networks (NNs) provide a unique approach to learn the characteristics of normal system behavior, identify when abnormal conditions occur, and flag these conditions for system operators. This study applies a 24-hour load forecast for distribution line devices given the weather forecast and day of the week, then determines the current state of distribution devices based on changes in SCADA analogs from communicating line devices. A neural network-based algorithm is applied to historical events on Alabama Power's distribution system to identify de-energized sections of line when a significant amount of SCADA information is hidden.",M.

8,Reliability Analysis of Electricity Distribution Networks with Sampling Method; A Case Study of Sistan and Baluchestan Network,"Finding the causes of outages and the most suitable solution for reducing them, in an economically optimal way, has always been one of the main challenges for electricity distribution companies.

12,A Probabilistic Convolution-Based Model for the Equivalent Reliability of the Distribution System,"In traditional reliability assessment of power transmission systems, the distribution network is often equivalenced with a constant load, which is no longer able to meet the reliability evaluation requirements of modern power systems. Hence, this paper suggests a precise alternative model for evaluating the reliability of power transmission systems' distribution networks, employing probabilistic convolution. The continuous load curve of the distribution network undergoes discretization, transforming into a discrete probability model of load demand. Furthermore, using the sequential Monte Carlo approach, a discrete probability distribution model is developed for the distribution network's failure intensity. By utilizing the theory of probabilistic convolution, the problem of solving the precise equivalent model of the distribution network is transformed into determining the joint probability density distribution and expectation of independent distributed two-dimensional discrete random variables. This approach accurately reflects the impact of variations in both the distribution network's load level and reliability level on the power transmission system. As a result, it achieves the precise equivalent of the distribution network's load level in reliability assessment.

13,Preliminary Design of Solid State Transformer Application for Power Distribution System in Indonesia,"Power converters are widely used in power systems such as inverters for solar power generation or rectifiers in electric vehicle battery chargers. In addition, AC-AC converters are also used in wind power plants to stabilize the power output. Solid state transformer (SST) is a power transformer consisting of a high frequency transformer, power converter and control circuit, which is designed to provide a high level of control flexibility. In the future, this control flexibility can be developed so that SST has the ability to solve the above problems. This study project the potential application of SST for power distribution system at PT. PLN (Persero) and designed the SST topology based on the expected functions according to the available literature. The SST topology is selected based on the capability to perform the expected functions and the switching components are selected based on their commercially available ratings. Based on these considerations, a three-stage SST configuration with h-bridge module and dual active bridge was chosen using the highest voltage rating available of IGBT.

15,A Review On The Connotation And Supporting Requirements Of Virtual Inertia In Active Distribution Systems,"The active distribution network has poor disturbance resistance, and the network security boundary is difficult to characterize and evaluate. It is necessary to characterize the virtual inertia, and the distributed source load support ability in the distribution network is limited and difficult to coordinate control under various disturbances. It is urgent to establish a virtual inertia adaptive allocation and collaborative control method for the self governance area of the distribution network. This article first introduces the connotation of virtual inertia, and based on this, proposes the support capacity of virtual inertia in distribution systems and the evaluation of system inertia requirements.

16,The Real-time Digital Simulation System for Distribution Network,"With the access of large-scale distributed power and electric vehicles, the operation state of modern distribution network is more complex and changeable. In this paper, kinds of operation scenarios that may occur in the field operation of the system are fully considered. Combined with the wide area measurement and control system function of the distribution network, the test scheme is designed based on the actual distribution network and a typical test case is established.

The distributed generation is connected at the distribution level and may consist of a large number of small generators with stochastic power output. Therefore, planning and operation of the future distribution grid requires new tools to ensure reliable and economical operation. One such tool is an on-line simulator. A system that uses an on-line simulator in the Energy Control Center (ECC) will enhance the operators' situational awareness as well as operational decision making. This paper proposes a framework for an on-line, close to real time simulator, connected to a graphical user interface emulating the Energy Control Center.

18,Surge Arrester Placement in Wind Turbine System by Evaluation Overvoltages of Direct Lightning Strike to the Wind Turbine Blades and Overhead Distribution Lines,"With the increasing use of renewable energy, the design of lightning protection system in generating electricity from wind energy is an important issue. Most wind turbines are installed in areas with high lightning density, high altitudes and rocky areas. Therefore, wind turbines are strongly affected by the direct impact of lightning on the wind turbine blades and even on the adjacent ground. On the other hand, the ground system is one of the most important components required in a lightning protection system suitable for wind turbines that proper design with an effective surge arrester is essential for the safety of people and equipment and the reduction of transient overvoltages on wind turbine electronic equipment.

21,Towards the Decentralized Energy Optimization of Active Unbalanced Distribution Systems Integrated with Natural Gas Systems,"This article presents the ADMM-based decentralized multi-period energy optimization of an active unbalanced power distribution system integrated with the natural gas distribution network. The second-order cone programming (SOCP) based relaxations are utilized to convexify the nonconvexities involved in the multi-energy system. The relaxation error in each subsystem problem is iteratively reduced to predefined accepted levels. The power distribution subsystem problem is modeled as a bi-level problem. Level 1 solves the linearized version, and level 2 solves the nonlinear version of the subsystem problem. The sequential bound tightening algorithm and solution recovery procedures are proposed to recover meaningful solutions to the original nonconvex subsystems problem from their relaxed counterparts. The proposed solution procedure minimizes the multi-period operation cost of the multi-energy system. The simulations are conducted on an active unbalanced IEEE-13 bus distribution network and a 6-node natural gas distribution network.

22,Fault Modeling and Simulation Based on Cyber Physical System in Complex Distribution Network,"With the high penetration of renewable energy in distribution network and the gradual improvement of smart grid construction, the physical processing and information processing are closely coupled. Complex distribution network is a typical cyber physical system(CPS). The sequential property of electric power system and the time-discrete property of communication system have made the research of CPS for distribution network complicated. In view of dynamic process of CPS for distribution network, the fusion modeling and large-scale simulation calculation and platform of CPS for distribution network were investigated. First, the characteristics and the interaction principle of CPS for distribution network were analyzed. And the coupling mode of CPS for distribution network was proposed. Next, the simulation model of physical system was proposed. From different information data types, information data flow was modeled. On this basis, a framework for integration of multiple cyber physical modules was constructed. And CPS fusion method was proposed. Taking the simulation platform of CPS for distribution network as example, characteristics of RT-LAB as the physical simulation tool, and OPNET as the information simulation tool were analyzed. And the feasibility of co-simulation of RT-LAB and OPNET was elaborated. Finally, a fast simulation framework based on RT-LAB was established. And a cooperative simulation for electrical power system and control system was proposed. Based on the essential difference between physical events and information events, two kinds of simulation timing synchronization methods suitable for physical model and information model were presented. A 62-nodes distribution network with distributed generators of an area was modeled on RT-LAB. The simulation results of CPS platform based on RT-LAB and OPNET show that when a single-phase fault occurs in a complex distribution network, communication problems such as congestion delays and error codes of information system in the transmission of measurement data and control instruction cause failures to be dealt with in time delay to trigger a cascading fault. The results effectively verified the importance of control information system to monitor distribution network. At the same time, the CPS simulation platform for the actual environment of complex distribution network is necessary.","Y. Zhao, M. Bai, Y. Liang, J. Ma and P.

23,Considering the Impact of PV-Battery Systems on Long-Term Distribution Network Planning,"In recent decades, distributed generation (DG), more specifically renewable ones, has been widely used in power distribution systems due to different reasons. Photovoltaic (PV) systems are one of the practical resources that can be utilized in different sizes. However, from the peaks shaving standpoint, they could not be lonely effective. In this paper, the impact of the joint implementation of PV and battery systems in long-term planning is considered. These systems are conducted to reduce the total peak of the network which can cause postponement in the requirement of system upgrading. To reach this aim, firstly a sensitivity analyses is performed to determine the required load reduction. Then, through particle swarm optimization (PSO) the best site and size of PV-battery systems are determined. In order to catch the uncertainty of solar irradiance and the load of system, a k-means data crusting method is employed. The proposed method is verified via a real 104-bus test system. Obtained results demonstrate how PV-battery systems can affect on long-term planning by deferring the need of system to upgrade instruments.","A. Ashoornezhad, Q. Asadi, R. Saberi and H.

24,Optimal Energy Flow of Unbalanced Power Distribution System Integrated with District Heating System,"This paper presents the decentralized 15-minute time interval multi-period energy optimization of an active Unbalanced three-phase Power Distribution System (UPDS) interconnected with the District Heating System (DHS). The UPDS subsystem problem is formulated as a bi-level problem, where level-1 solves the linear three-phase power flow approximation, and level-2 solves the nonlinear convex versions of the subsystem problem. The variable mass flow rate in DHS brings increased system flexibility compared to the constant flow rate and, therefore, enhances energy optimization of the heating system. The McCormick envelopes based polyhedral relaxations and the Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) relaxations are employed to convexify the nonconvexities involved in the integrated UPDS-DHS system. The relaxation error in each subsystem problem is iteratively reduced below predefined acceptance levels. The proposed approach minimizes the integrated system's multi-period operation cost and is implemented on an active unbalanced IEEE-13 bus distribution network and a 30-node DHS.",A. Sharma and N. P.

27,Detection of Faulty Regions in Power Distribution Grid with Limited Measurement,"Restoration of power supply after occurrence of faults in distribution lines is utmost challenging task for operators due to lack of sufficient real time information in the distribution system territory. Recently initiatives are taken by distribution companies to install micro phasor measurement units (μPMUs) and sensors to monitor and recognize the injurious area in the system. However, implementation of the projects are still challenging due to high investment cost. The present study tries to highlight a machine learning based approach to identify faulty region in the distribution system with limited installation of μPMU. A random forest (RF) classifier is utilized to assess the faulty region in the distribution grid with low state information supplied by μPMUs. The method endows the training with a large simulated data obtained from installed μPMUs for different types and location of faults in three phases of the system. Proposed methodology has been tested on IEEE 13 bus unbalanced distribution system. The efficacy of the proposed approach is established with the test results. The investigation also depicts the efficiency of RF algorithm in fault detection in comparison with other classifier such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN).","D.

With the continuous expansion of the application scope of key equipment in emerging distribution networks represented by intelligent terminals, new-generation business master stations, low-voltage intelligent switches, grid-connected inverters, etc., various emerging technologies and the power industry further intersect, so that the specific realization of the key functions of the power distribution system gradually evolves from the original independent policy control to the complex digital application scenario of multi-level division of labor, multi-equipment cooperation and multi-strategy collaboration, which has triggered profound changes in the production mode of the industry.Based on the top architecture of ""cloud-side, channel layer, edge-side and perception layer"" and intelligent equipment represented by intelligent terminal, the digitalized system of low-voltage distribution system reconstructs the data flow and signal flow of low-voltage platform area, which is an important research part to support the construction of new power system.

30,Weibull Distribution Based Reliability Analysis of Radial Distribution System with Aging Effect of Transformer,"Reliability is associated with the system’s capability to survive. In the past years, consumer’s expectations have been increased with the development and advancement in modem technologies. They are expecting more quality supply with less cost and fewer failures. Therefore, reliability investigation of the Radial Distribution System (RDS) significantly ensures the service continuity at the consumer’s end. Further, with the age, equipment failure rate also increases, which also increases the failure frequency and interruption cost significantly for consumers. A prediction of the failure rate for proper maintenance scheduling and replacement of old equipment is necessary. To achieve the future recurrence rate of interruption for the transformer in real-time, the Weibull Probability Density Function is used here. In this research work, the frequency of interruption with different time intervals, variable shape parameters having an effect on Expected Interruption Cost (ECOST) and Energy Not Served (ENS) is studied.

32,Electro-thermal Resource Interaction to Accommodate Inevitable Uncertain Events of Distribution Network,"Transition of the power system towards a carbon-neutral grid with increased prosumers at the distribution end motivates the distribution market to be more robust. Rare uncertain events like power supply failures from the main grid due to contingencies, high forecast errors, etc., could adversely impact the distribution system’s operations. In such situations, distribution system operators (DSOs) are forced to curtail the load at the cost of high economic losses and consumers’ discomfort. This entails the DSOs to be more diligent to accommodate these rare, inevitable, and uncertain events. Electro-thermal interaction could significantly help the DSO to maintain an economical and reliable system. In this regard, this work formulates the distribution optimal power flow (D-OPF) to accommodate these rare events and prevent the system from collapsing or heavy load shedding via efficient deployment of the network’s available resources. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated on IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system considering different real-time scenarios.

33,An Online Monitoring Method for Stabilizing Inflection Points of Photovoltaic Distribution Systems Containing a High Percentage,"The conventional online monitoring method for the stability inflection point of high proportion photovoltaic distribution system mainly uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) to obtain the monitoring threshold, which is vulnerable to the influence of frequency spectrum and frequency band fitting, resulting in abnormal inflection point status monitoring.

That is, the dynamic characteristics of online monitoring of stability inflection point of high proportion photovoltaic distribution system are extracted, and the stability of online monitoring of stability inflection point of high proportion photovoltaic distribution system is judged, thus realizing online monitoring of stability inflection point of distribution system. The experimental results show that the online monitoring method with high proportion of photovoltaic distribution system stability inflection point in this paper can normally complete inflection point status monitoring under different time stamps, which proves that the designed online monitoring method has good monitoring effect, reliability and certain application value, and has made certain contributions to ensuring the operation reliability of distribution system.",Sijie Liu; Hui Li; Fan Tian; Yunqing Xie; Xin Lu; Yuhan Duan,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601936,Distriution System,,,,convent onlin monitor method stabil inflect point high proport photovolta distribut system mainli use fft fast fourier transform obtain monitor threshold vulner influenc frequenc spectrum frequenc band fit result abnorm inflect point statu monitor base onlin monitor method stabil inflect point high proport photovolta distribut system propos dynam characterist onlin monitor stabil inflect point high proport photovolta distribut system extract stabil onlin monitor stabil inflect point high proport photovolta distribut system judg thu realiz onlin monitor stabil inflect point distribut system experiment result show onlin monitor method high proport photovolta distribut system stabil inflect point paper normal complet inflect point statu monitor differ time stamp prove design onlin monitor method good monitor effect reliabl certain applic valu made certain contribut ensur oper reliabl distribut system,onlin monitor method stabil inflect point photovolta distribut system contain high percentag,onlin monitor method stabil inflect point photovolta distribut system contain high percentag convent onlin monitor method stabil inflect point high proport photovolta distribut system mainli use fft fast fourier transform obtain monitor threshold vulner influenc frequenc spectrum frequenc band fit result abnorm inflect point statu monitor base onlin monitor method stabil inflect point high proport photovolta distribut system propos dynam characterist onlin monitor stabil inflect point high proport photovolta distribut system extract stabil onlin monitor stabil inflect point high proport photovolta distribut system judg thu realiz onlin monitor stabil inflect point distribut system experiment result show onlin monitor method high proport photovolta distribut system stabil inflect point paper normal complet inflect point statu monitor differ time stamp prove design onlin monitor method good monitor effect reliabl certain applic valu made certain contribut ensur oper reliabl distribut system
34,A Generalized Framework for Service Restoration in a Resilient Power Distribution System,"An electric power grid is one of the complex infrastructures, and because of its complex nature, there is simply no way that outages can be completely avoided. Thus, a modern society that depends on reliable electric supply requires a resilient electric system that can recover from disruptions while integrating emerging smart grid technologies. This article presents a novel approach for service restoration in a modern power distribution system with controllable switches and distributed generation (DG) resources for any kind of outage. The proposed framework supports both the traditional service restoration using feeder reconfiguration and the grid-forming DG-assisted intentional islands that are dynamically sized using algorithms based on the fault scenario, available resources, and priority of loads. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates critical system connectivity and operating constraints. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a large-scale four-feeder 1069-bus three-phase unbalanced distribution test system. It is demonstrated that the framework is effective in utilizing all available resources in quickly restoring the power supply to improve resiliency during extreme events and is scalable for a large-scale unbalanced power distribution system.","S.

35,Fault Location Algorithm for Multi-Terminal Transmission Lines of Distribution System Based on Loop-Analysis,"The safe and stable operation of power system is highly affected by transmission line fault. With the rapid development and application of multi-terminal transmission lines in distribution network, the researches on fault location methods of multi-terminal transmission lines are attracting more and more attention. However, the fault location algorithms for multi-terminal transmission lines is complicated and time-consuming. To improve the effectiveness and accuracy of fault location, a novel fault location algorithm for multi-terminal transmission lines in the distribution network is proposed in this paper. First, the directed graphs of distribution system with multi-terminal transmission lines are constructed and the nodes are classified as T-type and non-T-type nodes. Then the system is divided into multiple regions by each T-type node and the voltages of T-type node in different regions have been calculated by the loop-voltage equation to identify the fault region. Finally, non-fault regions have been merged to establish a new distribution system until both the fault branch and distance are determined. A practical distribution system has been established on the CloudPSS platform to test the method, and test results verify the practicality and accuracy of the proposed method.","H. Peng, W. Mo, Y.

This paper is a study of the impact of electric bus charging on the power distribution system a case study IEEE 33 bus test system. The study also included Ebus charging integrated with distributed generation (DG) system to improve voltage level. The power flow was calculated using the Newton-Raphson method and the size and location of DG calculated by the voltage deviation index (VDI). The simulation results show the impact of Ebus charging on the system. The fast charging of 6 minutes at 300 kW power, system voltage dropped 0.8139 p.u., mean voltage 0.9014 p.u. The voltage improvement by installing DG on buses 18 and 33 at 1.0 MW and 1.4 MW respectively. The results show that the system voltage increased to 0.9533 p.u., the voltage means 0.9735 p.u. The Ebus charging causes the voltage drop on the power system, which affects the reliability of the system. It is a larger load than the charging of electric vehicles.

39,Energy Storage as a Non-Wires Alternative for Deferring Distribution Capacity Investments,"There is growing interest in Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and other distributed energy resources (DER) as non-wires alternatives to resolve distribution issues while also providing valuable services to the grid and to energy customers. One such use is to defer distribution capacity investments required due to load and/or DER growth. Selecting ESS power and energy ratings for capacity deferral requires time-series load profile data. This paper is a part of a longer-term objective of making it easy for utilities to consider energy storage systems within distribution planning. This paper proposes a practical planning-based approach to screen ESS (both power and energy ratings) to defer distribution capacity investments. More specifically, an approach is presented here that leverages linear power flow approximation to quickly perform many time-series ESS dispatch simulations enabling rapid ESS project screening for a large number of distribution feeders. This paper also illustrates intuitive ways to visualize optimal ESS power and energy ratings for different peak clipping objectives.

41,Optimal Placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Station by Considering Dynamic Loads in Radial Distribution System,"Electric vehicles with unique characteristics like lower noise, energy saving and pollution free due to reduction of carbon dioxide are consider to be the best choice for future automobile industry. The battery of electric vehicle (EV) must get recharged at charging stations when they are used for driving in urban area. Since electric charging stations will be used simultaneously by many EV. The existing distribution system might not be highly affected by the installation of charging stations if the numbers of electric vehicles are small. However, with the increase in the number of electric vehicles the characteristics of the electric vehicle charging patterns may have considerable impact on distribution systems which depends particularly on the electric vehicle charging location. There may be significant impacts like overloading and power losses in the system. These impacts could be mitigated by proper system planning and through strategic placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) in the existing radial distribution network.

This investigation has been based on a case study in the Jordanian Electricity Distribution Company (EDCO) network. It presents technical and cost comparison between different distribution networks including different system typologies for the 0.4 kV, 0.6 kV and 1 kV distribution systems. The distribution network of Karak city in Jordan has been modeled using CYME software and updated with the grid data needed to perform the analysis, such as transmission line parameters and lengths; and transformers ratings. The study has been performed, firstly, by analyzing the current situation of the grid with 0.4 kV distribution voltage. Then the grid voltage has been raised to 0.6 kV and 1 kV to reduce the technical and non-technical energy losses.

44,DC coupled Distribution System Groups enable lowering Provision of Ancillary Services,"Since a significant number of renewable energy plants (RES) are connected to the distribution grid level, the ratio of feed-in to load in the distribution grids is very different. Today's centralized distribution system groups mean that balancing between systems is usually carried out via the transmission system, leading to additional bottlenecks and even to the shutdown of RES installations. This contribution presents a new approach to power balancing at the distribution system level. By means of DC couplings, controllable power transits between high-feed and high-load system groups are enabled, with the result that transmission losses and ancillary services to be provided can be reduced. The evaluation is carried out on basis of a generic medium-term model and shows that the concept idea enables a relief of the transmission system within the scope of power-frequency control as well as saving reserve power for power system restoration.","E.

The study in this paper applies specifically to the Gondar feeder, which consists of 60 nodes with 3,413 MW of total capacity, in power distribution lines. For the modulation of voltages and DS node power loss indices, the fuzzy membership functions are used.

46,Joint Sparse Estimation of Sensitivity Distribution Factors and Power Flows in Low-Observable Power Distribution Systems,"Sensitivity distribution factors (SDFs) have diverse applications in power system operation. In particular, when SDFs are obtained in a data-driven fashion based on measurements, they can eliminate the need to repeatedly solve the computationally complex non-linear power flow equations. However, in a typical low-observable power distribution system, where the measurements are not sufficient to achieve full-observability, it is a major challenge to estimate SDFs using the available measurements. This challenge is addressed in this paper. Specifically, a new method is proposed for joint estimation of SDF and power flows in power distribution systems that lack full-observability. The proposed method requires measuring the nodal injection power and line power flow at only a few locations on the power distribution feeder. The proposed method is physics-aware. It is built upon extracting physics-based sparsity features of power distribution feeders. In this regard, the aforementioned joint estimation problem is formulated as a sparse matrix completion problem. The advantages of the proposed method in comparison with the existing methods are investigated via numerical results.",Alireza Akrami; Hamed Mohsenian-Rad,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10066366/,Distriution System,,,,sensit distribut factor sdf divers applic power system oper particular sdf obtain datadriven fashion base measur elimin need repeatedli solv comput complex nonlinear power flow equat howev typic lowobserv power distribut system measur suffici achiev fullobserv major challeng estim sdf use avail measur challeng address paper specif new method propos joint estim sdf power flow power distribut system lack fullobserv propos method requir measur nodal inject power line power flow locat power distribut feeder propos method physicsawar built upon extract physicsbas sparsiti featur power distribut feeder regard aforement joint estim problem formul spars matrix complet problem advantag propos method comparison exist method investig via numer result,joint spars estim sensit distribut factor power flow lowobserv power distribut system,joint spars estim sensit distribut factor power flow lowobserv power distribut system sensit distribut factor sdf divers applic power system oper particular sdf obtain datadriven fashion base measur elimin need repeatedli solv comput complex nonlinear power flow equat howev typic lowobserv power distribut system measur suffici achiev fullobserv major challeng estim sdf use avail measur challeng address paper specif new method propos joint estim sdf power flow power distribut system lack fullobserv propos method requir measur nodal inject power line power flow locat power distribut feeder propos method physicsawar built upon extract physicsbas sparsiti featur power distribut feeder regard aforement joint estim problem formul spars matrix complet problem advantag propos method comparison exist method investig via numer result

The Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) is considered as a critical aspect in determining the selection of candidate buses for installation of DG and D-STATCOM. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of FPA it is implemented on 15, 33 and 69 bus radial distribution systems (RDS) to derive the locations and sizing of DG and D-STATCOM based on the selected candidate buses.

48,A Distributed Framework for Agent-based Optimal Energy Management of Distribution Systems,"In recent decades, distribution system restructuring has led to a fundamental shift towards distributed and integrated energy systems. Moreover, electricity market privatization requires distributed control of connected resources to help maintain data privacy. In future distribution systems, each participant will control its local resources optimally while supporting the efficient operation of the power distribution grid by adhering to its system and balance constraints. Consequently, this article proposes an agent-based, integrated, and hierarchical energy management framework for the distribution system operators and involved participants such as industrial or residential prosumers. The goal of such a framework is to optimize the desired targets of each participant locally while maintaining the system security of the distribution grid. The developed framework uses a combination of MATLAB and AKKA to construct the agent-based and hierarchical energy management structure. Finally, we use a distributed optimization routine based on a gradient-descent method to showcase the framework’s operation.",Debopama Sen Sarma; Sebastian Peter; Christian Rehtanz,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10407568,Distriution System,,,,recent decad distribut system restructur led fundament shift toward distribut integr energi system moreov electr market privat requir distribut control connect resourc help maintain data privaci futur distribut system particip control local resourc optim support effici oper power distribut grid adher system balanc constraint consequ articl propos agentbas integr hierarch energi manag framework distribut system oper involv particip industri residenti prosum goal framework optim desir target particip local maintain system secur distribut grid develop framework use combin matlab akka construct agentbas hierarch energi manag structur final use distribut optim routin base gradientdesc method showcas framework ’ oper,distribut framework agentbas optim energi manag distribut system,distribut framework agentbas optim energi manag distribut system recent decad distribut system restructur led fundament shift toward distribut integr energi system moreov electr market privat requir distribut control connect resourc help maintain data privaci futur distribut system particip control local resourc optim support effici oper power distribut grid adher system balanc constraint consequ articl propos agentbas integr hierarch energi manag framework distribut system oper involv particip industri residenti prosum goal framework optim desir target particip local maintain system secur distribut grid develop framework use combin matlab akka construct agentbas hierarch energi manag structur final use distribut optim routin base gradientdesc method showcas framework ’ oper
49,Enhancing Resilience of Distribution Systems Considering Electric Vehicles and Network Reconfiguration in Post-Extreme Events,"After extreme events, the uninterrupted power supply to critical loads in the distribution network faces significant challenges. Electric vehicles (EVs), as mobile energy storage units, can supply power to the distribution network through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, assisting in the restoration of the distribution network after outages. A collaborative fault restoration strategy is proposed considering the spatiotemporal distribution of EVs supplying power to the distribution network, while also considering the network reconfiguration strategy of the distribution network. The probability of EVs selecting V2G stations and the energy distribution of EVs are characterized. Based on this, a collaborative load restoration strategy considering network reconfiguration of the distribution network is constructed, and the model is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. Finally, a case study is conducted using the IEEE 33-node distribution network configuration to verify that the proposed strategy can enhance the load restoration capability in extreme scenarios.","X.

50,Active Management of Distribution Systems with High Penetration of Distributed Energy Resources,"Operational challenges introduced by integration of high penetration of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) are well known. These challenges range from technical constraint violations, such as: overloads on feeders, over- or under- voltages in network nodes, and reverse power flows, to inaccurate operational planning due to uncertain production of renewable resources. However, recent advances in specialized software packages for active management of DERs could turn these challenges into the operational and monetary benefits for both distribution utilities, as well as end customers. Hence, if managed and operated in an optimal way, DERs could be highly-valuable resources for increasing efficiency of the overall management of distribution grids, as well as for providing much-needed flexibility in the operation of today’s active systems. Utility Distribution Energy Resource Management Systems (Utility DERMS) aims to offer all these capabilities integrated in a single software package.

As system operations are siloed in transmission and distribution, the impacts of the DER and the effects of transmission events on distribution networks have necessitated the integrated study of the transmission and distribution networks. In addition, the limitations of conventional tools led to the approach of real-time system analysis for reliable operation. This paper aims to study the impacts of modeling inverter-based Resources (IBRs) and their responses in case of fault events.

53,SWOT Analysis of Distribution System in India: A Transition from Passive to Active,"India’s power system has been transiting towards a more decentralized operation with the deregulation being main driving force behind it. Apart from this, the adoption of renewable energy sources, reduction in aggregate losses, and growing energy access are some of the other driving factors. To support this, a lot of transformations needed to be done in the distribution sector to enhance energy efficiency, and maintain network security. A wide variety of distributed generation (DG) sources are needed to be integrated. Integrating, DG units in the distribution systems requires in-depth planning apart from the implementation of communication, active energy management, real-time monitoring, and distribution system (DS) automation. The application will create a need to transition from a passive distribution system (PDS) into active distribution systems (ADS). With an objective to create a strategic planning framework for this transition, this research presents a SWOT analysis to evaluate and compare both ADS and PDS highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to completely understand the present situation and future development needs of the distribution system for integration of the DG unit as well as the Renewable energy sources.

Distributed generators such as Photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines are added to the distribution feeder in constant power voltage mode. Load management is proposed by providing monetary benefits to the consumer for their active participation.

55,Current–Voltage Unbalanced Distribution AC Optimal Power Flow for Advanced Distribution Management System Applications,"Modern distribution systems are changing from passive load serving networks to active load and generation-inclusive networks. Accurate distribution systems modeling is critical for effective distribution system control, operation, and planning. This article proposes novel nonlinear and convex ac optimal power flow (ACOPF) models based on current–voltage (IVACOPF) formulation for an unbalanced distribution system with distributed energy resources (DERs). In the proposed formulation, untransposed distribution lines, shunt elements of distribution lines, distribution transformers, and DERs are modeled. The proposed nonlinear IVACOPF model is linearized and convexified using the Taylor series. The accuracy of the proposed nonlinear and convex IVACOPF approaches for modeling unbalanced distribution systems is compared with OpenDSS and the widely used LinDistFlow method. The proposed accurate convex IVACOPF model has multiple applications for distribution systems management, planning, and operation. Applications of the proposed model on two key parts of advanced distribution management systems (ADMS)—DERs scheduling and state estimation—are presented in this article. The proposed models are tested on the distribution feeder of an electric utility in Arizona with 2100 primary nodes and a large number of rooftop photovoltaic units.

Therefore, the impacts of various photovoltaic distributed generation units (PVDGs) operating modes and penetration levels on the steady-state voltage profile and stability of electrical distribution networks are investigated in this study. The voltage control mode (PV) and the constant power mode (PQ), and the PVDG units’ operation are considered and applied to the IEEE-33 bus radial distribution network. The PVDG unit's positions and penetration levels integrated into the network are modified to maintain ±5% bus voltage levels. The distribution system’s total power loss (PL) and loading margin (LM) are recorded for each case study. The results show an improved voltage profile, higher LM and minimal PL for the PV mode of PVDG operation units more than the PQ mode.

57,Multi-Objective Topology Reconfiguration Strategy for Promoting PV Consumption of Distribution Systems,"The use of intermittent new energy sources is an important part of driving the low-carbon transition of the power system. PV (Photovoltaic) grid-connected increases the volatility of the distribution system. As the basis of power system operation, the topology can directly influence the PV generation and flow distribution. To promote PV consumption, the flexibility of the distribution system topology needs to be fully utilized. A topology optimization strategy is proposed in this paper to cope with the increasing penetration of PV in distribution systems. First, a multi-objective topology reconfiguration model considering PV consumption and power quality is established. After that, an improved multi-objective discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal solution set. Finally, gray relational analysis is applied to select the optimal reconfiguration plan. The case study results of the IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate that this strategy can effectively promote PV consumption.",Zhengxing Ren; Xiaodong Chu; Hua Ye,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330949,Distriution System,,,,use intermitt new energi sourc import part drive lowcarbon transit power system pv photovolta gridconnect increas volatil distribut system basi power system oper topolog directli influenc pv gener flow distribut promot pv consumpt flexibl distribut system topolog need fulli util topolog optim strategi propos paper cope increas penetr pv distribut system first multiobject topolog reconfigur model consid pv consumpt power qualiti establish improv multiobject discret particl swarm optim algorithm use find optim solut set final gray relat analysi appli select optim reconfigur plan case studi result ieee 33bu system demonstr strategi effect promot pv consumpt,multiobject topolog reconfigur strategi promot pv consumpt distribut system,multiobject topolog reconfigur strategi promot pv consumpt distribut system use intermitt new energi sourc import part drive lowcarbon transit power system pv photovolta gridconnect increas volatil distribut system basi power system oper topolog directli influenc pv gener flow distribut promot pv consumpt flexibl distribut system topolog need fulli util topolog optim strategi propos paper cope increas penetr pv distribut system first multiobject topolog reconfigur model consid pv consumpt power qualiti establish improv multiobject discret particl swarm optim algorithm use find optim solut set final gray relat analysi appli select optim reconfigur plan case studi result ieee 33bu system demonstr strategi effect promot pv consumpt

62,A Robust Data-Driven Gaussian Process Regression-Enabled Distribution System State Estimation using Partial Node Data,"Distribution system state estimation (DSSE) plays a critical role in real-time system operation but its accuracy is frequently compromised due to not only the inadequacy of measurement devices but also the susceptibility of measurements to gross errors, bad data, and loss of communications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a robust and scalable Gaussian process regression (RS-GPR)-enabled DSSE method. It allows accurate pseudo-measurement inference as well as robust state estimation with only a limited number of measurements. The method is implemented and tested using a real-world 2135-node Dominion Energy distribution system.

65,Integration of Small Pumped Storage Hydropower Units in Water Distribution System Operation,"Pumped-storage hydropower (PSH) is a proven energy storage technology that can provide large capacity support to the bulk power system. PSH is also a promising technology to increase energy storage capabilities of water distribution systems (WDSs), because these systems have most components necessary for supporting PSH, including a water supply, conduit, pumps, and water storage capacity. PSH must be sized to the water infrastructure that the energy storage will be integrated with, but generally these PSH applications are significantly smaller than traditional PSH units. This paper develops an optimization framework for integration of small PSH units in WDS operation to minimize operating costs associated with power and water consumption in WDS. The proposed model takes into account the hydraulic constraints of WDS and provides optimal operating strategies from an economic perspective based on available units in WDS (e.g., the hydropower generator, variable speed water pumps, and utilization of water storage capacity). The proposed model is applied to a 16-node test WDS using two cases that differ in terms of PSH design to demonstrate the merits of the proposed model. The results provide insight into improved operations for the test system. They also provide the basis for improving operations of more complex WDS systems, including enabling evaluation of PSH design and integration.",Majid Majidi; Luis Rodriguez-Garcia; Masood Parvania; Thomas M.

Aiming at the goal of realizing the peak and valley self-balancing of the distribution networks, this paper designs a new scheme of spot trading in the distribution network, and elaborate on the two-way quotation, quotation by time and clearing method of real-time spot trading in this scheme. In this research, the difference of the spot trading between provincial-level and distribution networks was first clarified to clear the mutual relationship and transaction goals of these two markets. Secondly, the objective function and bidding mode of day-ahead trading and real-time trading have been set up reasonably to achieve two-way optimization of the load and the power. What's more, the nodal pricing of distribution networks suitable for clearing in the local market has also been considered. Finally, we proposed a spot trading solution that can achieve the coordinated operation of the distribution networks and the provincial networks, which is committed to achieving the optimal economic operation of generation, consumption, storage and load of the electricity in distribution networks.",Peng Yu; Yupeng Xiao; Chao Gong; Yu Yu,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9713568,Distriution System,,,,background develop lowcarbon economi increas complex distribut system distribut network propos higher demand optim strategi econom oper aim goal realiz peak valley selfbalanc distribut network paper design new scheme spot trade distribut network elabor twoway quotat quotat time clear method realtim spot trade scheme research differ spot trade provinciallevel distribut network first clarifi clear mutual relationship transact goal two market secondli object function bid mode dayahead trade realtim trade set reason achiev twoway optim load power what nodal price distribut network suitabl clear local market also consid final propos spot trade solut achiev coordin oper distribut network provinci network commit achiev optim econom oper gener consumpt storag load electr distribut network,spot trade scheme realiz selfbalanc oper electr power distribut network,spot trade scheme realiz selfbalanc oper electr power distribut network background develop lowcarbon economi increas complex distribut system distribut network propos higher demand optim strategi econom oper aim goal realiz peak valley selfbalanc distribut network paper design new scheme spot trade distribut network elabor twoway quotat quotat time clear method realtim spot trade scheme research differ spot trade provinciallevel distribut network first clarifi clear mutual relationship transact goal two market secondli object function bid mode dayahead trade realtim trade set reason achiev twoway optim load power what nodal price distribut network suitabl clear local market also consid final propos spot trade solut achiev coordin oper distribut network provinci network commit achiev optim econom oper gener consumpt storag load electr distribut network
68,Research on The Impact of 100% PV Penetration in Power Distribution Systems,"This paper investigates the impact of increased penetration of renewable energy, more specifically, PV systems, in future distribution systems. As it is known, grid-connected PVs at the distribution level serve as promising solutions to the growth in electrical demand and a cleaner, more eco-friendly environment in many countries worldwide. Due to the rise in electrical demand, consumption, and greenhouse gas levels, there is great potential that the total demand would be met by PV systems in some appropriate conditions, hence, operating the power distribution network with a 100% PV penetration scenario. Thus, it is a topic with great interest to most researchers and power system operators to analyze the effects of 100% PV penetration on distribution systems. This paper is focused on steady-state analysis and harmonics at full load conditions with 100% PV penetration. The simulation results of this paper have demonstrated the level of suitability of 100% PV penetration on distribution systems. The results of this paper are concerned with the effects of 100% PV penetration on the voltage level, the losses, the reverse power flow, and the harmonics level in the system. Although it is a target to increase the share of PVs in future scenarios, the analysis results show that it is worthwhile to consider the negative impacts associated with it. These negative impacts might include the violation of voltage limits, reverse power flow into the system, and harmonic order levels, especially at low load conditions. The simulations are performed in DIgSILENT Power Factory, where a modified version of the IEEE 13- node test system is used to demonstrate the findings of this paper.",Rafat Aljarrah; Jumana Abu-Hamad; Murad Al-Omary; Qusay Salem,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10050466,Distriution System,,,,paper investig impact increas penetr renew energi specif pv system futur distribut system known gridconnect pv distribut level serv promis solut growth electr demand cleaner ecofriendli environ mani countri worldwid due rise electr demand consumpt greenhous ga level great potenti total demand would met pv system appropri condit henc oper power distribut network 100 pv penetr scenario thu topic great interest research power system oper analyz effect 100 pv penetr distribut system paper focus steadyst analysi harmon full load condit 100 pv penetr simul result paper demonstr level suitabl 100 pv penetr distribut system result paper concern effect 100 pv penetr voltag level loss revers power flow harmon level system although target increas share pv futur scenario analysi result show worthwhil consid neg impact associ neg impact might includ violat voltag limit revers power flow system harmon order level especi low load condit simul perform digsil power factori modifi version ieee 13 node test system use demonstr find paper,research impact 100 pv penetr power distribut system,research impact 100 pv penetr power distribut system paper investig impact increas penetr renew energi specif pv system futur distribut system known gridconnect pv distribut level serv promis solut growth electr demand cleaner ecofriendli environ mani countri worldwid due rise electr demand consumpt greenhous ga level great potenti total demand would met pv system appropri condit henc oper power distribut network 100 pv penetr scenario thu topic great interest research power system oper analyz effect 100 pv penetr distribut system paper focus steadyst analysi harmon full load condit 100 pv penetr simul result paper demonstr level suitabl 100 pv penetr distribut system result paper concern effect 100 pv penetr voltag level loss revers power flow harmon level system although target increas share pv futur scenario analysi result show worthwhil consid neg impact associ neg impact might includ violat voltag limit revers power flow system harmon order level especi low load condit simul perform digsil power factori modifi version ieee 13 node test system use demonstr find paper
69,Impact of Active Distribution Network on Contingency Analysis of Transmission System,"Conventionally, the power system security is ensured through transmission system (TS) contingency analysis. The distribution system (DS) is considered as a fixed aggregated load at the point of connection bus where the quantum of load indicates the power demand of DS from the grid. However, this demand is no longer fixed with the proliferation of renewable energy based distributed generation (DG). The temporal variations associated with the power output of DGs eventually produces uncertainty in the power drawn by a DS from the grid. Thus, any component outage which is not severe may become critical under the instance of sudden increase in load (power demand by DS) and alters the result of contingency analysis (CA). Hence, to prevent missing out alarm signals during such events, the system operators need to communicate with each other for performing security analysis. In this paper, a transmission contingency analysis method has been proposed that considers the impact of active distribution network with exchange of limited data at the point of connection bus between the system operators. To shorten the computation time, criteria for selecting the sensitive load buses is also proposed.

70,Distribution System Reliability Evaluation in Presence of DG,"In modern distribution power systems Distributed Generation (DG) is performing a major role in supplying energy to the distribution system loads. Reliability indices of distribution system with DG is a key parameter used to evaluate the advantages of adding such DG to the distribution system. Distribution system reliability is calculated by using two main techniques analytical and simulative. In this paper, the effect of connecting Photovoltaic (PV) source and energy storage element to the distribution system on its reliability performance will be analyzed. Markov modelling is used to generate a realistic multi state model for PV and battery, the output failure and repair rates results from the modeling are then used in the reliability evaluation of distribution system. The overall system reliability is carried out using NEPLAN software package. Roy Billinton bus 2 Test System is used to evaluate reliability and cost indices for different case studies. The simulation results show that PV plus energy storage integration will improve the reliability indices of the original distribution system in condition of optimum sizing and siting of the PV plus energy storage systems.",A.T.

71,Evaluation of distribution network planning considering scalability and adaptability,"With economy development and population increasing, it is significant to restruct and expand distribution network to follow electricity demand. In order to reduce investment costs and increase efficiency, it is necessary to scientifically and reasonably evaluate planning schemes and construct distribution network. In this paper, an evaluation system is established to evaluate comprehensively for distribution network planning. It not only includes reliability and economy, but also scalability and adaptability to adapt future development. Due to high penetration of distributed energy access, it makes a great influence to distribution network. As for uncertainties, it takes advantage of fuzzy membership function to describe working state of wind turbine, photovoltaic and electric vehicle. Based on mean and variance, Monte Carlo method can simulate the data of wind speed, light intensity and electric vehicle.

72,Effects of Load Models and Load Growth in Distribution System in Presence of Distributed Generator,"The power distribution systems always need special attention for its planning and control. The distribution systems must be persistently adjustable to increasing load demand with satisfying the voltage range and without defying highest current conveying potential of the conductors. Properly planned distribution systems can lower capital investment, subtract system power losses and to provide improved quality of powers to consumers. This paper reviewed the works done by researchers previously on the effects of load models and load growth on system power loss and voltage profile. An IEEE 13-bus radial electrical distribution test network is considered and simulated.

73,A Comparison of a Recloser Performance in a Passive and Active Distribution System,"A recloser is a protection device used to mitigate long power interruptions during transient faults in passive distribution systems. Passive distribution systems are becoming active because of the integration of distributed generation. This generation introduces a reverse power flow and consequently a reverse fault current. The pick-up and operation time of the recloser can be affected because of the change in the fault current level. It is essential to study and compare the recloser's pick-up activity and operation time before setting the recloser in an active distribution system. This study, therefore, develops a virtual single-shot reclosing scheme and its performance tested in a passive and active distribution system. Matlab/SimulinkiSimscape power systems environment is used to simulate cases. Simulations are conducted for four case studies to identify issues in the performance of the recloser when there is distributed generation.

74,Two-Level Optimisation and Control Strategy for Unbalanced Active Distribution Systems Management,"This article proposes a new approach to the operation of unbalanced Active Distribution Systems (ADS) using an economic dispatch optimisation model for Active Distribution Systems Management (ADSM). The model proposes a two-level control strategy. The first one poses an optimisation problem with the objective of minimising total active power losses in the ADS and the second one proposes an algorithm that controls the position of the taps of three-phase on-load tap-changer (OLTC) transformers to ensure compliance with the technical constraints imposed by the Distribution System Operator (DSO). The optimisation problem is solved by MATLAB R and DIgSILENT PowerFactory R for power systems static simulations. This paper includes a novel peer to peer communication framework between MATLAB R /DIgSILENT R . The control and optimisation strategy is validated on the IEEE 34-Node Distribution Test Feeder. This network incorporates balanced and unbalanced three-phase loads, single-phase loads in the different phases, and two-phase loads. In this scientific paper, photovoltaic (PV) and wind power generation (WT) have been integrated to test feeder operation, with the support of battery energy storage systems (BESS). The correct operation of the proposed ADSM is demonstrated using numerical simulation on five scenarios considering several configurations of the renewable generation units and the batteries. The strategy has also been validated in a more extensive distribution network, proving its good performance.",Lázaro Alvarado-Barrios; César Álvarez-Arroyo; Juan Manuel Escaño; Francisco M.

75,Feature-based High Impedance Fault Detection in the Distribution System Using Hilbert and Fourier Transforms,"This paper presents a new technique based on the combination of Hilbert and Fourier transforms for addressing the problem of high impedance faults (HIFs) detection in electrical distribution systems. HIFs are not efficiently detected by conventional protection systems because of their low current magnitudes. The proposed HIF detection method is as follows: First, perform the Hilbert transform on each phase current to obtain the instantaneous phase signal. Second, apply the Fourier transform to obtain the spectrum of these instantaneous phase signals and the instantaneous phase of synthetic pure sinusoidal signal to calculate the error spectrum. HIF index is calculated as sum of the error spectrum. Finally, HIF is detected using change point detection (CPD) technique on the HIF index. A large number of simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC software on the IEEE 123-node test feeder and field data tests on different HIFs and non-HIFs cases show that the method has high detection and low false positive rates.",Mohammad Razeghi-Jahromi; Moein Choobineh,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10556186,Distriution System,,,,paper present new techniqu base combin hilbert fourier transform address problem high imped fault hif detect electr distribut system hif effici detect convent protect system low current magnitud propos hif detect method follow first perform hilbert transform phase current obtain instantan phase signal second appli fourier transform obtain spectrum instantan phase signal instantan phase synthet pure sinusoid signal calcul error spectrum hif index calcul sum error spectrum final hif detect use chang point detect cpd techniqu hif index larg number simul pscademtdc softwar ieee 123node test feeder field data test differ hif nonhif case show method high detect low fals posit rate,featurebas high imped fault detect distribut system use hilbert fourier transform,featurebas high imped fault detect distribut system use hilbert fourier transform paper present new techniqu base combin hilbert fourier transform address problem high imped fault hif detect electr distribut system hif effici detect convent protect system low current magnitud propos hif detect method follow first perform hilbert transform phase current obtain instantan phase signal second appli fourier transform obtain spectrum instantan phase signal instantan phase synthet pure sinusoid signal calcul error spectrum hif index calcul sum error spectrum final hif detect use chang point detect cpd techniqu hif index larg number simul pscademtdc softwar ieee 123node test feeder field data test differ hif nonhif case show method high detect low fals posit rate
76,Multi-objective Optimal Configuration Scheme of Energy Storage in Wind-Photovoltaic-Energy Storage Hybrid Distribution Network System,"Energy storage system (ESS) can solve the problems of nodal voltage fluctuation and increase power loss in distribution network caused by high penetration of renewable energy. This paper takes the nodal voltage fluctuation and comprehensive multi-cost of ESS as the composite optimization objective, and combines multiple constraints to establish an energy storage configuration optimization model of the wind-solar-energy storage hybrid distribution network. Based on the optimization model, an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (IMOPSO) is introduced to solve the problem. IMOPSO avoids the particle swarm from falling into the local optimal solution while considering the convergence speed and accuracy. Finally, through analysis of the IEEE-33 node distribution network system, the rationality of the proposed ESS configuration optimization model and the IMOPSO are verified, which can effectively reduce the nodal voltage fluctuation and power loss of the distribution network, and improve the system economy at the same time.",Jingda Gu; Baotong Song; Ning Su; Xiaohui Bai; Wei Li; Rui Zhao,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10082293,Distriution System,,,,energi storag system ess solv problem nodal voltag fluctuat increas power loss distribut network caus high penetr renew energi paper take nodal voltag fluctuat comprehens multicost ess composit optim object combin multipl constraint establish energi storag configur optim model windsolarenergi storag hybrid distribut network base optim model improv multiobject particl swarm optim imopso introduc solv problem imopso avoid particl swarm fall local optim solut consid converg speed accuraci final analysi ieee33 node distribut network system ration propos ess configur optim model imopso verifi effect reduc nodal voltag fluctuat power loss distribut network improv system economi time,multiobject optim configur scheme energi storag windphotovoltaicenergi storag hybrid distribut network system,multiobject optim configur scheme energi storag windphotovoltaicenergi storag hybrid distribut network system energi storag system ess solv problem nodal voltag fluctuat increas power loss distribut network caus high penetr renew energi paper take nodal voltag fluctuat comprehens multicost ess composit optim object combin multipl constraint establish energi storag configur optim model windsolarenergi storag hybrid distribut network base optim model improv multiobject particl swarm optim imopso introduc solv problem imopso avoid particl swarm fall local optim solut consid converg speed accuraci final analysi ieee33 node distribut network system ration propos ess configur optim model imopso verifi effect reduc nodal voltag fluctuat power loss distribut network improv system economi time
77,Research on Vulnerability Assessment Method and Protection Safety Check Method Based on New Power System,"The essence of the concept of defense system is to provide critical and wide area information in real time, quickly evaluate the system vulnerability, and according to the vulnerability analysis of the system, perform timely self-healing, adaptive reconstruction of network structure and power distribution scheme, and provide support for the safe and stable operation of the power grid. Due to the change of the role of new energy, for the new power system, the original passive energy absorption object of the power grid is transformed into an effective support subject that actively participates in the control and adjustment of the power grid and abnormal operation occurs on the system side, and there are obvious differences in the selection of protection strategy and the corresponding system vulnerability evaluation. In this paper, based on the research of the protection strategy and automatic device action strategy of the active distribution network after the access of new energy, the system vulnerability analysis method based on the active distribution network is analyzed. At the same time, for the high vulnerability area, the hierarchical protection coordination strategy based on the three-level coordination principle is given. Through the refined protection action area coordination, the vulnerability level of the area is effectively reduced. At the medium voltage power grid level, due to the global evaluation requirements for the safety of the power grid protection strategy, combined with the idea of system stable classification and safe operation margin, a hierarchical rating system for systematic protection safety based on the integration of regional protection scheme and wide area protection set list is proposed.",Lin Xia; Liu Yuanlong; Wang Zhenghao; Li Qiang,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10532342,Distriution System,,,,essenc concept defens system provid critic wide area inform real time quickli evalu system vulner accord vulner analysi system perform time selfheal adapt reconstruct network structur power distribut scheme provid support safe stabl oper power grid due chang role new energi new power system origin passiv energi absorpt object power grid transform effect support subject activ particip control adjust power grid abnorm oper occur system side obviou differ select protect strategi correspond system vulner evalu paper base research protect strategi automat devic action strategi activ distribut network access new energi system vulner analysi method base activ distribut network analyz time high vulner area hierarch protect coordin strategi base threelevel coordin principl given refin protect action area coordin vulner level area effect reduc medium voltag power grid level due global evalu requir safeti power grid protect strategi combin idea system stabl classif safe oper margin hierarch rate system systemat protect safeti base integr region protect scheme wide area protect set list propos,research vulner assess method protect safeti check method base new power system,research vulner assess method protect safeti check method base new power system essenc concept defens system provid critic wide area inform real time quickli evalu system vulner accord vulner analysi system perform time selfheal adapt reconstruct network structur power distribut scheme provid support safe stabl oper power grid due chang role new energi new power system origin passiv energi absorpt object power grid transform effect support subject activ particip control adjust power grid abnorm oper occur system side obviou differ select protect strategi correspond system vulner evalu paper base research protect strategi automat devic action strategi activ distribut network access new energi system vulner analysi method base activ distribut network analyz time high vulner area hierarch protect coordin strategi base threelevel coordin principl given refin protect action area coordin vulner level area effect reduc medium voltag power grid level due global evalu requir safeti power grid protect strategi combin idea system stabl classif safe oper margin hierarch rate system systemat protect safeti base integr region protect scheme wide area protect set list propos
78,Anomaly Detection Based on Generalized Gaussian Distribution approach for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Indoor Positioning System,"With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), Indoor Positioning System (IPS) has attracted significant interest in academic research. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is an emerging technology that can be employed for IPS as it offers centimetre-level accuracy. However, the UWB system still faces several technical challenges in practice, one of which is Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) signal propagation. Several machine learning approaches have been applied for the NLoS component identification. However, when the data contains a very small amount of NLoS components it becomes very difficult for existing algorithms to classify them. This paper focuses on employing an anomaly detection approach based on Gaussian Distribution (GD) and Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) algorithms to detect and identify the NLoS components. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can provide a robust NLoS component identification which improves the NLoS signal classification accuracy which results in significant improvement in the UWB positioning system.",Fuhu Che; Qasim Zeeshan Ahmed; Faheem A.

80,A Complex Multi-level System Reliability Distribution Estimation Method Based on Bayesian Melding Method,"As the complexity of system structure increases, system reliability estimation is challenging for lack of time and cost. How to enhance the system reliability distribution for complex multi-level structures is of great value. Besides, when there exists reliability distribution information of subsystems or components, how to fully use the limited information of different system levels for the system reliability distribution estimation has great significance. Therefore, considering that Bayesian Networks can construct complex system structures intuitively as well as evaluate the system reliability effectively, and the Bayesian Melding Method can integrate the multi-level information adequately, a complex multi-level system reliability distribution estimation method is proposed. The complex system structure is first decomposed to many blocks by BN. The single block system reliability distribution is obtained based on the Bayesian Melding Method with information integrated and Bayesian Networks with reliability estimated. The final system reliability distribution is estimated by merging the distributions obtained in different blocks so as to enhance the system reliability distribution with more information from different levels.

The selection of candidate buses for installation of capacitors are determined by a key factor termed as Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF). The effectiveness of FPA is demonstrated by implementing it on 12, 28 and 85 bus RDS to derive the locations and sizing of capacitors based on selected candidate buses.

85,Risk-Based Probabilistic Quantification of Power Distribution System Operational Resilience,"It is of growing concern to ensure the resilience in electricity infrastructure systems to extreme weather events with the help of appropriate hardening measures and new operational procedures. An effective mitigation strategy requires a quantitative metric for resilience that can not only model the impacts of the unseen catastrophic events for complex electric power distribution networks, but also evaluate the potential improvements offered by different planning measures. In this article, we propose probabilistic metrics to quantify the operational resilience of the electric power distribution systems to high-impact low-probability (HILP) events. Specifically, we define two risk-based measures: value-atrisk (V aR α ) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR α ) that measure resilience as the maximum loss of energy and conditional expectation of a loss of energy, respectively, for the events beyond a prespecified risk threshold, α. Next, we present a simulation-based framework to evaluate the proposed resilience metrics for different weather scenarios with the help of modified IEEE 37-bus and IEEE 123-bus system. The simulation approach is also extended to evaluate the impacts of different planning measures on the proposed resilience metrics.",Shiva Poudel;Anamika Dubey;Anjan Bose,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8848458/,Distriution System,,,,grow concern ensur resili electr infrastructur system extrem weather event help appropri harden measur new oper procedur effect mitig strategi requir quantit metric resili model impact unseen catastroph event complex electr power distribut network also evalu potenti improv offer differ plan measur articl propos probabilist metric quantifi oper resili electr power distribut system highimpact lowprob hilp event specif defin two riskbas measur valueatrisk v ar α condit valueatrisk cvar α measur resili maximum loss energi condit expect loss energi respect event beyond prespecifi risk threshold α next present simulationbas framework evalu propos resili metric differ weather scenario help modifi ieee 37bu ieee 123bu system simul approach also extend evalu impact differ plan measur propos resili metric,riskbas probabilist quantif power distribut system oper resili,riskbas probabilist quantif power distribut system oper resili grow concern ensur resili electr infrastructur system extrem weather event help appropri harden measur new oper procedur effect mitig strategi requir quantit metric resili model impact unseen catastroph event complex electr power distribut network also evalu potenti improv offer differ plan measur articl propos probabilist metric quantifi oper resili electr power distribut system highimpact lowprob hilp event specif defin two riskbas measur valueatrisk v ar α condit valueatrisk cvar α measur resili maximum loss energi condit expect loss energi respect event beyond prespecifi risk threshold α next present simulationbas framework evalu propos resili metric differ weather scenario help modifi ieee 37bu ieee 123bu system simul approach also extend evalu impact differ plan measur propos resili metric

Solar photo voltaic cell (SPV) is considered as DG technology. A real time power delivery data of solar photovoltaic cell (SPV) is used for the sake of analysis. While placing the DG the transmission loss is minimized, bus voltages are improved and total cost of operations is minimized.

To solve this problem, a distributed fault section location method for active distribution network (ADN) is proposed. The key points of this method are the Bayesian complete analytic model and the dimension reduction. Firstly, a distributed fault diagnosis model is constructed based on the multi-agent system (MAS), and the fundamental of fault section location is analyzed. Secondly, considering the missing and false positives of the feeder terminal unit (FTU), a Bayesian complete analytic model is proposed with the minimum variable dimension reduced by the fault contradiction theory. Finally, the whole process of the fault location method is directly given.

82,Advanced Autonomous Voltage-Control Method using Sensor Data in a Distribution Power System,"PVs have been rapidly incorporated within power distribution systems after the operation of Feed In Tariff (FIT). Step Voltage Regulator (SVR) with Line Drop Compensator method has been installed to the power distribution system to control rising voltages due to the reverse flow from PVs. LDC controls the distribution voltage based on the estimated voltage obtained via sensor measurements in real-time. However, using LDC, it is difficult to maintain the distribution voltage within a specified range because the estimation error expands with increasing PV installed capacity. In Japan, a type of automatic switch with voltage and current sensors (IT-switch) has been installed to detect an accident point in the power distribution system. IT-switching can monitor line voltage and current in each phase, and measured data are transferred to data servers. This paper proposes an advanced, autonomous voltage-control method to improve the estimation accuracy and voltage control performance of SVR, using the reference database to address the voltage deviation problem. The proposed method estimates a voltage width of the control target voltage in real-time as a reference voltage by using the measured (online) data and database (offline) data. To determine the validity of the proposed method, we conducted numerical simulations and compared the voltage control performance and the influence of SVR life span using a model power distribution system. The results indicates that the proposed method improved the voltage control performance and SVR life span by improving the estimation accuracy through the integration of real-time measured data and the reference database.",Naoyuki Takahashi,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8849001,Distriution System,,,,pv rapidli incorpor within power distribut system oper feed tariff fit step voltag regul svr line drop compens method instal power distribut system control rise voltag due revers flow pv ldc control distribut voltag base estim voltag obtain via sensor measur realtim howev use ldc difficult maintain distribut voltag within specifi rang estim error expand increas pv instal capac japan type automat switch voltag current sensor itswitch instal detect accid point power distribut system itswitch monitor line voltag current phase measur data transfer data server paper propos advanc autonom voltagecontrol method improv estim accuraci voltag control perform svr use refer databas address voltag deviat problem propos method estim voltag width control target voltag realtim refer voltag use measur onlin data databas offlin data determin valid propos method conduct numer simul compar voltag control perform influenc svr life span use model power distribut system result indic propos method improv voltag control perform svr life span improv estim accuraci integr realtim measur data refer databas,advanc autonom voltagecontrol method use sensor data distribut power system,advanc autonom voltagecontrol method use sensor data distribut power system pv rapidli incorpor within power distribut system oper feed tariff fit step voltag regul svr line drop compens method instal power distribut system control rise voltag due revers flow pv ldc control distribut voltag base estim voltag obtain via sensor measur realtim howev use ldc difficult maintain distribut voltag within specifi rang estim error expand increas pv instal capac japan type automat switch voltag current sensor itswitch instal detect accid point power distribut system itswitch monitor line voltag current phase measur data transfer data server paper propos advanc autonom voltagecontrol method improv estim accuraci voltag control perform svr use refer databas address voltag deviat problem propos method estim voltag width control target voltag realtim refer voltag use measur onlin data databas offlin data determin valid propos method conduct numer simul compar voltag control perform influenc svr life span use model power distribut system result indic propos method improv voltag control perform svr life span improv estim accuraci integr realtim measur data refer databas
93,Evaluation of Single-Phase PV Smart Inverter Functions in Unbalanced Residential Distribution Systems,"Rooftop single-phase PV smart inverters in residential distribution systems are becoming more common throughout the United States. As a result, utilities are experiencing increases in the numbers of operations for voltage regulators and on-load tap changers under certain operating conditions for high PV penetration levels which may lead to reduced maintenance intervals. However, PV smart inverters can be controlled under different functions or operating modes with some potentially reducing the number of operations of voltage regulators and thus, increasing maintenance intervals. To this end, three selected functions of PV smart inverters are evaluated on a case study based on a 13.8-kV modified IEEE 37-bus system controlled under conservation voltage reduction and integrated Volt/VAr using EPRI OpenDSS™ software package to demonstrate that some functions do positively assist in voltage regulation and reactive power control.",Darren Symonette; Juan Carlos Balda,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9494207,Distriution System,,,,rooftop singlephas pv smart invert residenti distribut system becom common throughout unit state result util experienc increas number oper voltag regul onload tap changer certain oper condit high pv penetr level may lead reduc mainten interv howev pv smart invert control differ function oper mode potenti reduc number oper voltag regul thu increas mainten interv end three select function pv smart invert evalu case studi base 138kv modifi ieee 37bu system control conserv voltag reduct integr voltvar use epri opendss™ softwar packag demonstr function posit assist voltag regul reactiv power control,evalu singlephas pv smart invert function unbalanc residenti distribut system,evalu singlephas pv smart invert function unbalanc residenti distribut system rooftop singlephas pv smart invert residenti distribut system becom common throughout unit state result util experienc increas number oper voltag regul onload tap changer certain oper condit high pv penetr level may lead reduc mainten interv howev pv smart invert control differ function oper mode potenti reduc number oper voltag regul thu increas mainten interv end three select function pv smart invert evalu case studi base 138kv modifi ieee 37bu system control conserv voltag reduct integr voltvar use epri opendss™ softwar packag demonstr function posit assist voltag regul reactiv power control
94,Incentive-based Ramp-up Minimization in Multi-Microgrid Distribution Systems,"Installation of renewable energy sources (RESs) in power systems has been dramatically increased due to clean nature and declining investment costs in recent years. This growing trend has led to new issues in the system operational management such as intense ramps inflicted on the network called system flexibility constraints. In this regard, due to decreasing the investment in bulk flexible resources, utilities would be significantly rely on local flexible ramp resources in the system to meet the supply-demand gap in each time-period. However, development of independently operated microgrids (MGs) as a result of restructuring and privatization in the power systems has imposed limitations over the access of system operators on the operational scheduling of local flexible resources. Consequently, this paper aims to provide a framework, which enables the distribution system operator (DSO) to exploit the operational scheduling of local flexible resources in MGs with the aim of decreasing the flexible ramp-up in the system. In the proposed scheme, DSO provides bonuses to MGs collaborated in alleviating the flexible ramp-up issue in the distribution system. Moreover, Stackelberg game concept is taken into account to model the bi-level optimization in the decentralized operated system, where DSO is regarded as the leader and MGs are considered as followers. Finally, the provided flexibility-based resource scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently operate a three-microgrid system considering flexibility ramp constraints.",Sajjad Fattaheian-Dehkordi; Mehdi Tavakkoli; Ali Abbaspour; Mahmud Fotuhi-Firuzabad; Matti Lehtonen,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9248921,Distriution System,,,,instal renew energi sourc ress power system dramat increas due clean natur declin invest cost recent year grow trend led new issu system oper manag intens ramp inflict network call system flexibl constraint regard due decreas invest bulk flexibl resourc util would significantli reli local flexibl ramp resourc system meet supplydemand gap timeperiod howev develop independ oper microgrid mg result restructur privat power system impos limit access system oper oper schedul local flexibl resourc consequ paper aim provid framework enabl distribut system oper dso exploit oper schedul local flexibl resourc mg aim decreas flexibl rampup system propos scheme dso provid bonus mg collabor allevi flexibl rampup issu distribut system moreov stackelberg game concept taken account model bilevel optim decentr oper system dso regard leader mg consid follow final provid flexibilitybas resourc schedul framework implement effici oper threemicrogrid system consid flexibl ramp constraint,incentivebas rampup minim multimicrogrid distribut system,incentivebas rampup minim multimicrogrid distribut system instal renew energi sourc ress power system dramat increas due clean natur declin invest cost recent year grow trend led new issu system oper manag intens ramp inflict network call system flexibl constraint regard due decreas invest bulk flexibl resourc util would significantli reli local flexibl ramp resourc system meet supplydemand gap timeperiod howev develop independ oper microgrid mg result restructur privat power system impos limit access system oper oper schedul local flexibl resourc consequ paper aim provid framework enabl distribut system oper dso exploit oper schedul local flexibl resourc mg aim decreas flexibl rampup system propos scheme dso provid bonus mg collabor allevi flexibl rampup issu distribut system moreov stackelberg game concept taken account model bilevel optim decentr oper system dso regard leader mg consid follow final provid flexibilitybas resourc schedul framework implement effici oper threemicrogrid system consid flexibl ramp constraint

Firstly, the principle and mathematical model of the ESOP are expounded. Secondly, the flexibility and economy of distribution network are analyzed, and the net load regulation and branch load margin are proposed as the evaluation indexes of distribution network flexibility from the adjustment ability of node and grid flexibility resources. Taking the operation cost of distribution network and the construction cost of ESOP planning as economic indicators, an optimal dispatching model with flexible and economic operation of distribution network containing ESOP planning as objective function is established.

99,Probability distribution model for annual maximum wind speed,"Wind is one of the green energy sources, but it has some fluctuations in speed and direction. Many researchers have worked on analyzing the wind speed attributes in order to find the best place for wind turbines. This research discusses the best model distribution for annual maximum of average wind speed using probability distribution models. In this research, four model distributions are assigned to wind speed data and their goodness of fit is evaluated using graphical plots and AIC/BIC. The Extreme Value model is the best fit for both annual maximum of average wind speed and total average wind speed observations.",Mohammad Reza Yazdi-Samadi,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10062643,Distriution System,,,,wind one green energi sourc fluctuat speed direct mani research work analyz wind speed attribut order find best place wind turbin research discuss best model distribut annual maximum averag wind speed use probabl distribut model research four model distribut assign wind speed data good fit evalu use graphic plot aicbic extrem valu model best fit annual maximum averag wind speed total averag wind speed observ,probabl distribut model annual maximum wind speed,probabl distribut model annual maximum wind speed wind one green energi sourc fluctuat speed direct mani research work analyz wind speed attribut order find best place wind turbin research discuss best model distribut annual maximum averag wind speed use probabl distribut model research four model distribut assign wind speed data good fit evalu use graphic plot aicbic extrem valu model best fit annual maximum averag wind speed total averag wind speed observ
100,Transient Behaviour of Distribution Power Systems in the Presence of Six Disruptive Technologies,"This study analyses the transient behaviour of distribution power systems (PS) in the presence of six disruptive technologies: electric vehicles (EV), photovoltaic systems (PV), wind turbines (WT), energy storage systems (ESS), vehicle to grid (V2G), and demand response (DR). Whilst all the technologies have been extensively studied, the studies typically focus on small subsets of two to three technologies, and analyse small number of scenarios. This study is based on the data sets resulting from 966,306 transient simulations, performed on the standard IEEE 123 Node Test System, for various combinations of technology penetration rates. The key finding is that the solar and wind-induced transients are relatively moderate in comparison to the transients induced by faults or circuit breaker operations.",Miroslav Blagojevic; Terrence Summers; Robert Betz,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10215849,Distriution System,,,,studi analys transient behaviour distribut power system ps presenc six disrupt technolog electr vehicl ev photovolta system pv wind turbin wt energi storag system ess vehicl grid v2g demand respons dr whilst technolog extens studi studi typic focu small subset two three technolog analys small number scenario studi base data set result 966306 transient simul perform standard ieee 123 node test system variou combin technolog penetr rate key find solar windinduc transient rel moder comparison transient induc fault circuit breaker oper,transient behaviour distribut power system presenc six disrupt technolog,transient behaviour distribut power system presenc six disrupt technolog studi analys transient behaviour distribut power system ps presenc six disrupt technolog electr vehicl ev photovolta system pv wind turbin wt energi storag system ess vehicl grid v2g demand respons dr whilst technolog extens studi studi typic focu small subset two three technolog analys small number scenario studi base data set result 966306 transient simul perform standard ieee 123 node test system variou combin technolog penetr rate key find solar windinduc transient rel moder comparison transient induc fault circuit breaker oper
