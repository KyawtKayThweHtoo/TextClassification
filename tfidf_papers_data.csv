AI in health and medicine,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to broadly reshape medicine, potentially improving the experiences of both clinicians and patients. We discuss key findings from a 2-year weekly effort to track and share key developments in medical AI. We cover prospective studies and advances in medical image analysis, which have reduced the gap between research and deployment. We also address several promising avenues for novel medical AI research, including non-image data sources, unconventional problem formulations and human–AI collaboration. Finally, we consider serious technical and ethical challenges in issues spanning from data scarcity to racial bias. As these challenges are addressed, AI’s potential may be realized, making healthcare more accurate, efficient and accessible for patients worldwide. AI has the potential to reshape medicine and make healthcare more accurate, efficient and accessible; this Review discusses recent progress, opportunities and challenges toward achieving this goal.",Artificial Intelligence,ai health medicin,artifici intellig ai pois broadli reshap medicin potenti improv experi clinician patient discuss key find 2year weekli effort track share key develop medic ai cover prospect studi advanc medic imag analysi reduc gap research deploy also address sever promis avenu novel medic ai research includ nonimag data sourc unconvent problem formul humanai collabor final consid seriou technic ethic challeng issu span data scarciti racial bia challeng address ai potenti may realiz make healthcar accur effici access patient worldwid ai potenti reshap medicin make healthcar accur effici access review discuss recent progress opportun challeng toward achiev goal,ai health medicin artifici intellig ai pois broadli reshap medicin potenti improv experi clinician patient discuss key find 2year weekli effort track share key develop medic ai cover prospect studi advanc medic imag analysi reduc gap research deploy also address sever promis avenu novel medic ai research includ nonimag data sourc unconvent problem formul humanai collabor final consid seriou technic ethic challeng issu span data scarciti racial bia challeng address ai potenti may realiz make healthcar accur effici access patient worldwid ai potenti reshap medicin make healthcar accur effici access review discuss recent progress opportun challeng toward achiev goal,0.0,0.0,0.19129182475506698,0.0,0.0,0.08231269519568447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1809940664407963,0.0,0.0877929723838544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4555423155019043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0646341519920561,0.0,0.07479768888390412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08531770873540241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2051287238968068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11174751786100212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877929723838544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233344843481706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923487223270587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0553475027323736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1690740886712799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15662938992467001,0.11593653462922364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11593653462922364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08377665924399648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861197638413407,0.09347653636190112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11376715861359127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10332614874284898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24165347787170574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068240812469224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06623856336988622,0.07535529012584334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07958764247577496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09049703322039815,0.19129182475506698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755859447677088,0.0,0.0,0.09244930183715194,0.0,0.0,0.3242507839066336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10053611668416275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10332614874284898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26083324498900623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08091847073985495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11376715861359127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10808359463554452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08866686355062575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08866686355062575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212556969763296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09145689560931197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10189790548005427,0.0,0.11174751786100212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0627449042394687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048276665873301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09347653636190112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Learning Deep Architectures for AI,"Theoretical results strongly suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one needs deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.",Artificial Intelligence,learn deep architectur ai,theoret result strongli suggest order learn kind complic function repres highlevel abstract eg vision languag ailevel task one need deep architectur deep architectur compos multipl level nonlinear oper neural net mani hidden layer complic proposit formula reus mani subformula search paramet space deep architectur difficult optim task learn algorithm deep belief network recent propos tackl problem notabl success beat stateoftheart certain area paper discuss motiv principl regard learn algorithm deep architectur particular exploit build block unsupervis learn singlelay model restrict boltzmann machin use construct deeper model deep belief network,learn deep architectur ai theoret result strongli suggest order learn kind complic function repres highlevel abstract eg vision languag ailevel task one need deep architectur deep architectur compos multipl level nonlinear oper neural net mani hidden layer complic proposit formula reus mani subformula search paramet space deep architectur difficult optim task learn algorithm deep belief network recent propos tackl problem notabl success beat stateoftheart certain area paper discuss motiv principl regard learn algorithm deep architectur particular exploit build block unsupervis learn singlelay model restrict boltzmann machin use construct deeper model deep belief network,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06583233451721619,0.0,0.13915936377039018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4302254531985004,0.06957968188519509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255852654513511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09089451994157245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6458681083839656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07330082136060953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10476707904712092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07766278330206361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08959257601683464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29837776080381356,0.08105212273648822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08293315660791752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14795544784083928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11141424555929322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08959257601683464,0.0,0.0,0.06633497156967984,0.10755684504966212,0.09371768701703344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07199887743587172,0.0,0.0,0.06300916744175519,0.0,0.07137212110579398,0.0849648279641722,0.0,0.0,0.04267446435041746,0.09226687262628079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09525648188302653,0.0,0.0701632096921468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050311815628321974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07688172654730369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10052685518888044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09864582131745114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05004321691345473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10052685518888044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09089451994157245,0.09226687262628079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569372792220258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689462067894324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0387903267584938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10718627459779756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, Taxonomies, Opportunities and Challenges toward Responsible AI","In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed
appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this
to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability,
an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural
Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models).
Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely
acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in
this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a
prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define
explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that
covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability
is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions
related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining
Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This
critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI,
such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept
of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI
methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our
ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve
as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and
professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any
prior bias for its lack of interpretability",Artificial Intelligence,explain artifici intellig xai concept taxonomi opportun challeng toward respons ai,last year artifici intellig ai achiev notabl

HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face,"Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. While there are numerous AI models available for various domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks autonomously. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional abilities in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks, with language serving as a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, an LLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT can tackle a wide range of sophisticated AI tasks spanning different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards the realization of artificial general intelligence.",Artificial

Can AI-Generated Text be Reliably Detected?,"The unregulated use of LLMs can potentially lead to malicious consequences such as plagiarism, generating fake news, spamming, etc. Therefore, reliable detection of AI-generated text can be critical to ensure the responsible use of LLMs. Recent works attempt to tackle this problem either using certain model signatures present in the generated text outputs or by applying watermarking techniques that imprint specific patterns onto them. In this paper, we show that these detectors are not reliable in practical scenarios. In particular, we develop a recursive paraphrasing attack to apply on AI text, which can break a whole range of detectors, including the ones using the watermarking schemes as well as neural network-based detectors, zero-shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors. Our experiments include passages around 300 tokens in length, showing the sensitivity of the detectors even in the case of relatively long passages. We also observe that our recursive paraphrasing only degrades text quality slightly, measured via human studies, and metrics such as perplexity scores and accuracy on text benchmarks. Additionally, we show that even LLMs protected by watermarking schemes can be vulnerable against spoofing attacks aimed to mislead detectors to classify human-written text as AI-generated, potentially causing reputational damages to the developers. In particular, we show that an adversary can infer hidden AI text signatures of the LLM outputs without having white-box access to the detection method. Finally, we provide a theoretical connection between the AUROC of the best possible detector and the Total Variation distance between human and AI text distributions that can be used to study the fundamental hardness of the reliable detection problem for advanced language models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/vinusankars/Reliability-of-AI-text-detectors.",Artificial Intelligence,aigener text reliabl detect,unregul use llm potenti lead malici consequ

From local explanations to global understanding with explainable AI for trees,"Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees and gradient boosted trees are popular nonlinear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model’s performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains. Tree-based machine learning models are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance and public services. The authors present an explanation method for trees that enables the computation of optimal local explanations for individual predictions, and demonstrate their method on three medical datasets.",Artificial Intelligence,local explan global understand explain ai tree,treebas machin learn model random forest decis tree gradient boost tree popular nonlinear predict model yet compar

Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback,"As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.",Artificial Intelligence,constitut ai harmless ai feedback,ai system becom capabl would like enlist help supervis ai experi method train harmless ai assist selfimprov without human label identifi harm output human oversight provid list rule principl refer method constitut ai process involv supervis learn reinforc learn phase supervis phase sampl initi model gener selfcritiqu revis finetun origin model revis respons rl phase sampl finetun model use model evalu two sampl better train prefer model dataset ai prefer train rl use prefer model reward signal ie use rl ai feedback rlaif result abl train harmless nonevas ai assist engag harm queri explain object sl rl method leverag chainofthought style reason improv humanjudg perform transpar ai decis make method make possibl control ai behavior precis far fewer human label,constitut ai harmless ai feedback ai system becom capabl would like enlist help supervis ai experi method train harmless ai assist selfimprov without human label identifi harm output human oversight provid list rule principl refer method constitut ai process involv supervis learn reinforc learn phase supervis phase sampl initi model gener selfcritiqu revis finetun origin model revis respons rl phase sampl finetun model use model evalu two sampl better train prefer model dataset ai prefer train rl use prefer model reward signal ie use rl ai feedback rlaif result abl train harmless nonevas ai assist engag harm queri explain object sl rl method leverag chainofthought style reason improv humanjudg perform transpar ai decis make method make possibl control ai behavior precis far fewer human label,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6265755273338774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17070654624369716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07175789376858652,0.08873874037716267,0.0,0.0,0.07983388930410341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06719770453582609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06070870027719971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07751995480727025,0.0,0.0,0.07751995480727025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05696141157580704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06285304269552724,0.0,0.09274289826446817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049085072552010126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06935965181684657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20159311360747828,0.0,0.06070870027719971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049695169145530134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08242064799302401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644842204878934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10326851425126966,0.0,0.08698083722578444,0.07351579691996475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317325252977326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894012957029714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2892034473599568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644842204878934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698083722578444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05490738620745275,0.0,0.2560598193655458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108920610606421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08242064799302401,0.0,0.0,0.04376717698268055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05064331919166838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08535327312184858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698083722578444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644842204878934,0.04329988137423903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515141415742267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08535327312184858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036243021158855804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2837161529241766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06789497151293773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10068996263862283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07864646147438864,0.0,0.0
Why Johnny Can’t Prompt: How Non-AI Experts Try (and Fail) to Design LLM Prompts,"Pre-trained large language models (“LLMs”) like GPT-3 can engage in fluent, multi-turn instruction-taking out-of-the-box, making them attractive materials for designing natural language interactions. Using natural language to steer LLM outputs (“prompting”) has emerged as an important design technique potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting effective prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based interactions are brittle. Here, we explore whether non-AI-experts can successfully engage in “end-user prompt engineering” using a design probe—a prototype LLM-based chatbot design tool supporting development and systematic evaluation of prompting strategies. Ultimately, our probe participants explored prompt designs opportunistically, not systematically, and struggled in ways echoing end-user programming systems and interactive machine learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were barriers to effective prompt design. These findings have implications for non-AI-expert-facing LLM-based tool design and for improving LLM-and-prompt literacy among programmers and the public, and present opportunities for further research.",Artificial Intelligence,johnni cant prompt nonai expert tri fail design llm prompt,pretrain larg languag model llm like gpt3 engag fluent multiturn instructiontak outofthebox make attract materi design natur languag interact use natur languag steer llm output prompt emerg import design techniqu potenti access nonaiexpert craft effect prompt challeng howev promptbas interact brittl explor whether nonaiexpert success engag endus prompt engin use design probea prototyp llmbase chatbot design tool support develop systemat evalu prompt strategi ultim probe particip explor prompt design opportunist systemat struggl way echo endus program system interact machin learn system expect stem humantohuman instruct experi tendenc overgener barrier effect prompt design find implic nonaiexpertfac llmbase tool design improv llmandprompt literaci among programm public present opportun research,johnni cant prompt nonai expert tri fail design llm prompt pretrain larg languag model llm like gpt3 engag fluent multiturn instructiontak outofthebox make attract materi design natur languag interact use natur languag steer llm output prompt emerg import design techniqu potenti access nonaiexpert craft effect prompt challeng howev promptbas interact brittl explor whether nonaiexpert success engag endus prompt engin use design probea prototyp llmbase chatbot design tool support develop systemat evalu prompt strategi ultim probe particip explor prompt design opportunist systemat struggl way echo endus program system interact machin learn system expect stem humantohuman instruct experi tendenc overgener barrier effect prompt design find implic nonaiexpertfac llmbase tool design improv llmandprompt literaci among programm public present opportun research,0.0,0.0,0.06670498769810193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07934303439767466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047686683323011535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38909133272342505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0386002328495834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09182059056704017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06311407709567035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05104102599937854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052950415053766346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08085599189725,0.058427180894052695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12895124085185422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651920301985266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047686683323011535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05550569366009334,0.046195832575549406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2131956827808763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21618392180457546,0.06122822185781559,0.0,0.0,0.047998377676379066,0.0,0.0,0.06833910628671738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527994955760707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06670498769810193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06122822185781559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04480648140864597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14213045518725087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07206130726819182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08085599189725,0.0,0.0,0.07421230368181622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060636424375951806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044539607234820755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593449687776698,0.0,0.0,0.6896984917387191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07661691309076663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04228283035873228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593449687776698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07310848980694211,0.0,0.0,0.05643383455788035,0.0,0.06738186291643566,0.1617119837945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05643383455788035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12127284875190361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06239985007356291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06920798565208966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Engineering Education in the Era of ChatGPT: Promise and Pitfalls of Generative AI for Education,"Engineering education is constantly evolving to keep up with the latest technological developments and meet the changing needs of the engineering industry. One promising development in this field is the use of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT has the potential to offer personalized and effective learning experiences by providing students with customized feedback and explanations, as well as creating realistic virtual simulations for hands-on learning. However, it is important to also consider the limitations of this technology. ChatGPT and other generative AI systems are only as good as their training data and may perpetuate biases or even generate and spread misinformation. Additionally, the use of generative AI in education raises ethical concerns such as the potential for unethical or dishonest use by students and the potential unemployment of humans who are made redundant by technology. While the current state of generative AI technology represented by ChatGPT is impressive but flawed, it is only a preview of what is to come. It is important for engineering educators to understand the implications of this technology and study how to adapt the engineering education ecosystem to ensure that the next generation of engineers can take advantage of the benefits offered by generative AI while minimizing any negative consequences.",Artificial Intelligence,engin educ era chatgpt promis pitfal gener ai educ,engin educ constantli evolv keep latest technolog develop meet chang need engin industri one promis develop field use gener artifici intellig technolog chatgpt convers agent chatgpt potenti offer person effect learn experi provid student custom feedback explan well creat realist virtual simul handson learn howev import also consid limit technolog chatgpt gener ai system good train data may perpetu bias even gener spread misinform addit use gener ai educ rais ethic concern potenti uneth dishonest use student potenti unemploy human made redund technolog current state gener ai technolog repres chatgpt impress flaw preview come import engin educ understand implic technolog studi adapt engin educ ecosystem ensur next gener engin take advantag benefit offer gener ai minim neg consequ,engin educ era chatgpt promis pitfal gener ai educ engin educ constantli evolv keep latest technolog develop meet chang need engin industri one promis develop field use gener artifici intellig technolog chatgpt convers agent chatgpt potenti offer person effect learn experi provid student custom feedback explan well creat realist virtual simul handson learn howev import also consid limit technolog chatgpt gener ai system good train data may perpetu bias even gener spread misinform addit use gener ai educ rais ethic concern potenti uneth dishonest use student potenti unemploy human made redund technolog current state gener ai technolog repres chatgpt impress flaw preview come import engin educ understand implic technolog studi adapt engin educ ecosystem ensur next gener engin take advantag benefit offer gener ai minim neg consequ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07608714957975175,0.06437158929897414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746229160510533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2584764070748986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04400839038498426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05809150297572472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651238164485523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07608714957975175,0.0,0.0,0.4208436986012832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245317943947903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0597768715554846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06938070146460046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060371890480247305,0.0,0.0,0.04198826756319263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753705102336501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39543330073654087,0.04482204024494368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2989869144634199,0.0,0.0651238164485523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07893938604581996,0.0,0.07746229160510533,0.0,0.07746229160510533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05704222630804741,0.0,0.0,0.09798430931752432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05755996070889606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3563769321936659,0.0,0.0,0.07746229160510533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04655632088297963,0.060985220525953426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083799796839584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05809150297572472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0541899898419792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09372125370210493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060371890480247305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245317943947903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294729397190316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746229160510533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07359244115275226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05208998052548914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14275106061232748,0.0,0.056537600525721286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17759730602281654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15492458321021066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04596130195821692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746229160510533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055096130140504365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748007901232211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287431785979483,0.04272203092845361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03289232352752785,0.0,0.0805347695799839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26893224146966205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06437158929897414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294729397190316,0.0,0.0,0.0913810913435681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226905021801985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0597768715554846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Large Language Models can be Guided to Evade AI-Generated Text Detection,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks and have been extensively utilized by the public. However, the increasing concerns regarding the misuse of LLMs, such as plagiarism and spamming, have led to the development of multiple detectors, including fine-tuned classifiers and statistical methods. In this study, we equip LLMs with prompts, rather than relying on an external paraphraser, to evaluate the vulnerability of these detectors. We propose a novel Substitution-based In-Context example Optimization method (SICO) to automatically construct prompts for evading the detectors. SICO is cost-efficient as it requires only 40 human-written examples and a limited number of LLM inferences to generate a prompt. Moreover, once a task-specific prompt has been constructed, it can be universally used against a wide range of detectors. Extensive experiments across three real-world tasks demonstrate that SICO significantly outperforms the paraphraser baselines and enables GPT-3.5 to successfully evade six detectors, decreasing their AUC by 0.5 on average. Furthermore, a comprehensive human evaluation show that the SICO-generated text achieves human-level readability and task completion rates, while preserving high imperceptibility. Finally, we propose an ensemble approach to enhance the robustness of detectors against SICO attack.

MEGA: Multilingual Evaluation of Generative AI,"Generative AI models have shown impressive performance on many Natural Language Processing tasks such as language understanding, reasoning, and language generation. An important question being asked by the AI community today is about the capabilities and limits of these models, and it is clear that evaluating generative AI is very challenging. Most studies on generative LLMs have been restricted to English and it is unclear how capable these models are at understanding and generating text in other languages. We present the first comprehensive benchmarking of generative LLMs - MEGA, which evaluates models on standard NLP benchmarks, covering 16 NLP datasets across 70 typologically diverse languages. We compare the performance of generative LLMs including Chat-GPT and GPT-4 to State of the Art (SOTA) non-autoregressive models on these tasks to determine how well generative models perform compared to the previous generation of LLMs. We present a thorough analysis of the performance of models across languages and tasks and discuss challenges in improving the performance of generative LLMs on low-resource languages. We create a framework for evaluating generative LLMs in the multilingual setting and provide directions for future progress in the field.",Artificial Intelligence,mega multilingu evalu gener ai,gener ai model shown impress perform mani natur languag process task languag understand reason languag gener import question ask ai commun today capabl limit model clear evalu gener ai challeng studi gener llm restrict english unclear capabl model understand gener text languag present first comprehens benchmark gener llm mega evalu model standard nlp benchmark cover 16 nlp dataset across 70 typolog divers languag compar perform gener llm includ chatgpt gpt4 state art sota nonautoregress model task determin well gener model perform compar previou gener llm present thorough analysi perform model across languag task discuss challeng improv perform gener llm lowresourc languag creat framework evalu gener llm multilingu set provid direct futur progress field,mega multilingu evalu gener ai gener ai model shown impress perform mani natur languag process task languag understand reason languag gener import question ask ai commun today capabl limit model clear evalu gener ai challeng studi gener llm restrict english unclear capabl model understand gener text languag present first comprehens benchmark gener llm mega evalu model standard nlp benchmark cover 16 nlp dataset across 70 typolog divers languag compar perform gener llm includ chatgpt gpt4 state art sota nonautoregress model task determin well gener model perform compar previou gener llm present thorough analysi perform model across languag task discuss challeng improv perform gener llm lowresourc languag creat framework evalu gener llm multilingu set provid direct futur progress field,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11131306991456597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18481498224446535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045518494350327794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090136482496534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322138289842299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07522758224327368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04966250583412417,0.0,0.10791729498099388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05626046855401854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06201046187540962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06287962620198823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06287962620198823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05820578131693557,0.051445426087400103,0.0,0.06475655371798711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18481498224446535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051445426087400103,0.0,0.0,0.05820578131693557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05342683680582159,0.0,0.0,0.05192050317334114,0.0,0.0,0.4777790732992127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04843344371257773,0.04030979723458832,0.045857825275650126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44015738341391764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05395864749049694,0.0,0.0,0.44117816865892573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05192050317334114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27368229032280256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06201046187540962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22268820518771984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.077729199213268,0.07055373735822103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03550135878470755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04107888076453614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055373735822103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06923355312011487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507240607069825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06577479284710704,0.0,0.06685478016611215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03818371411941733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16521721821209473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07352969477648762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11252093710803708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05342683680582159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
On the Reliability of Watermarks for Large Language Models,"As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood the internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. Watermarking is a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the detection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a 1e-5 false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.",Artificial Intelligence,reliabl watermark larg languag model,llm becom commonplac machinegener text potenti flood internet spam social media bot valueless content watermark simpl effect strategi mitig harm enabl detect document llmgener text yet crucial question remain reliabl watermark realist set wild watermark text may modifi suit user need entir rewritten avoid detect studi robust watermark text rewritten human paraphras nonwatermark llm mix longer handwritten document find watermark remain detect even human machin paraphras attack dilut strength watermark paraphras statist like leak ngram even longer fragment origin text result highconfid detect enough token observ exampl strong human paraphras watermark detect observ 800 token averag set 1e5 fals posit rate also consid rang new detect scheme sensit short span watermark text embed insid larg document compar robust watermark kind detector,reliabl watermark larg languag model llm becom commonplac machinegener text potenti flood internet spam social media bot valueless content watermark simpl effect strategi mitig harm enabl detect document llmgener text yet crucial question remain reliabl watermark realist set wild watermark text may modifi suit user need entir rewritten avoid detect studi robust watermark text rewritten human paraphras nonwatermark llm mix longer handwritten document find watermark remain detect even human machin paraphras attack dilut strength watermark paraphras statist like leak ngram even longer fragment origin text result highconfid detect enough token observ exampl strong human paraphras watermark detect observ 800 token averag set 1e5 fals posit rate also consid rang new detect scheme sensit short span watermark text embed insid larg document compar robust watermark kind detector,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03188405105340253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04560527474684678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047182163907238284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043739396542878575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04330830570749669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05719153535931067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2317960077252313,0.06835676117479092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1788116248506065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03247353986332255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04833801827064615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11224276273887247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056121381369436237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04611200991736385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13255126132147493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054193125225897365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05097082734331175,0.08661661141499338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04833801827064615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11920774990040434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047182163907238284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04560527474684678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031692783746507074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037739158008653746,0.0,0.0,0.03662780436014372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11025018368026583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054193125225897365,0.0,0.04288971203477824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05719153535931067,0.0,0.049594503498129786,0.0,0.054193125225897365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09023144077612107,0.11438307071862135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028470485863921455,0.0,0.0,0.10838625045179473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05249228276746732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08928443983407634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05834738972271853,0.0,0.0,0.0466371758122161,0.0,0.0,0.03095208443916697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.357623249701213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04560527474684678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.783661326268633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT,"Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC.",Artificial Intelligence,comprehens survey aigener content aigc histori gener ai gan chatgpt,recent chatgpt along dalle2

Regulating ChatGPT and other Large Generative AI Models,"Large generative AI models (LGAIMs), such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 or Stable Diffusion, are rapidly transforming the way we communicate, illustrate, and create. However, AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, has primarily focused on conventional AI models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI regulation, and ask how the law can be tailored to their capabilities. After laying technical foundations, the legal part of the paper proceeds in four steps, covering (1) direct regulation, (2) data protection, (3) content moderation, and (4) policy proposals. It suggests a novel terminology to capture the AI value chain in LGAIM settings by differentiating between LGAIM developers, deployers, professional and non-professional users, as well as recipients of LGAIM output. We tailor regulatory duties to these different actors along the value chain and suggest strategies to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained models. The paper argues for three layers of obligations concerning LGAIMs (minimum standards for all LGAIMs; high-risk obligations for high-risk use cases; collaborations along the AI value chain). In general, regulation should focus on concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding transparency and (ii) risk management. Non-discrimination provisions (iii) may, however, apply to LGAIM developers. Lastly, (iv) the core of the DSA's content moderation rules should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This includes notice and action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers.",Artificial Intelligence,regul chatgpt

Generative AI,"Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have made it possible for machines to independently produce a variety of creative content. In the context of producing creative content, this essay examines the developments, difficulties, and ethical issues relating to generative AI. It looks into how generative models, such Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto encoders (VAEs), can produce realistic artwork like music, literature, and visuals. However, it is frequently discovered that GAN training is extremely unstable and frequently experiences non-convergence, mode collapse, and hyperparameter sensitivity [1]. The technical details of developing and optimizing generative models to produce desired results are covered in detail in this work. It also looks at the difficulties in guaranteeing the variety, creativity, and coherence of generated content. Additionally, the use of generative AI in the creation of original material raises ethical questions. Included in this are concerns about intellectual property, plagiarism, and possible effects on the creative industries. In specifically, the article explores the consequences of employing generative AI for content production in terms of authorship, human creativity, and the possible disruption of traditional creative practices.

"Generative AI at Work
","We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,000 customer support agents. Access to the tool increases productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 14 percent on average, with the greatest impact on novice and low-skilled workers, and minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled workers. We provide suggestive evidence that the AI model disseminates the potentially tacit knowledge of more able workers and helps newer workers move down the experience curve. In addition, we show that AI assistance improves customer sentiment, reduces requests for managerial intervention, and improves employee retention.",Artificial Intelligence,gener ai work,studi stagger introduct gener aibas convers assist use data 5000 custom support agent access tool increas product measur issu resolv per hour 14 percent averag greatest impact novic lowskil worker minim impact experienc highli skill worker provid suggest evid ai model dissemin potenti tacit knowledg abl worker help newer worker move experi curv addit show ai assist improv custom sentiment reduc request manageri intervent improv employe retent,gener ai work studi stagger introduct gener aibas convers assist use data 5000 custom support agent access tool increas product measur issu resolv per hour 14 percent averag greatest impact novic lowskil worker minim impact experienc highli skill worker provid suggest evid ai model dissemin potenti tacit knowledg abl worker help newer worker move experi curv addit show ai assist improv custom sentiment reduc request manageri intervent improv employe retent,0.0,0.0,0.16362660722754652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16173660164952336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38966037168393297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892551958599474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10549746835177043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433212374287868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22385338993100137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15815799362610097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033743459737142,0.0,0.0,0.22663574683798363,0.0,0.0,0.129886790561311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15481814268824456,0.0,0.1767656007080184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16173660164952336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849044193061172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990981016115974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14874048759218964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1564602309092587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11547990141402417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516871729868571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136154861110499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19833886617359303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10734108281592535,0.0,0.0,0.18204197144828307,0.0,0.1384315806089172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14874048759218964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07653307579678331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12796042984278777,0.0
A comprehensive AI policy education framework for university teaching and learning,"This study aims to develop an AI education policy for higher education by examining the perceptions and implications of text generative AI technologies. Data was collected from 457 students and 180 teachers and staff across various disciplines in Hong Kong universities, using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Based on the findings, the study proposes an AI Ecological Education Policy Framework to address the multifaceted implications of AI integration in university teaching and learning. This framework is organized into three dimensions: Pedagogical, Governance, and Operational. The Pedagogical dimension concentrates on using AI to improve teaching and learning outcomes, while the Governance dimension tackles issues related to privacy, security, and accountability. The Operational dimension addresses matters concerning infrastructure and training. The framework fosters a nuanced understanding of the implications of AI integration in academic settings, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of their responsibilities and can take appropriate actions accordingly. Proposed AI Ecological Education Policy Framework for university teaching and learning. Three dimensions: Pedagogical, Governance, and Operational AI Policy Framework. Qualitative and quantitative data collected from students, teachers, and staff. Ten key areas identified for planning an AI policy in universities. Students should play an active role in drafting and implementing the policy. Proposed AI Ecological Education Policy Framework for university teaching and learning.

Art and the science of generative AI,"Understanding shifts in creative work will help guide AI’s impact on the media ecosystem The capabilities of a new class of tools, colloquially known as generative artificial intelligence (AI), is a topic of much debate. One prominent application thus far is the production of high-quality artistic media for visual arts, concept art, music, and literature, as well as video and animation. For example, diffusion models can synthesize high-quality images (1), and large language models (LLMs) can produce sensible-sounding and impressive prose and verse in a wide range of contexts (2). The generative capabilities of these tools are likely to fundamentally alter the creative processes by which creators formulate ideas and put them into production. As creativity is reimagined, so too may be many sectors of society. Understanding the impact of generative AI—and making policy decisions around it—requires new interdisciplinary scientific inquiry into culture, economics, law, algorithms, and the interaction of technology and creativity.",Artificial Intelligence,art scienc gener ai,understand shift creativ work help guid ai impact media ecosystem capabl new class tool colloqui known gener artifici intellig ai topic much debat one promin applic thu far product highqual artist media visual art concept art music literatur well video anim exampl diffus model synthes highqual imag 1 larg languag model llm produc sensiblesound impress prose vers wide rang context 2 gener capabl tool like fundament alter creativ process creator formul idea put product creativ reimagin may mani sector societi understand impact gener aiand make polici decis around itrequir new interdisciplinari scientif inquiri cultur econom law algorithm interact technolog creativ,art scienc gener ai understand shift creativ work help guid ai impact media ecosystem capabl new class tool colloqui known gener artifici intellig ai topic much debat one promin applic thu far product highqual artist media visual art concept art music literatur well video anim exampl diffus model synthes highqual imag 1 larg languag model llm produc sensiblesound impress prose vers wide rang context 2 gener capabl tool like fundament alter creativ process creator formul idea put product creativ reimagin may mani sector societi understand impact gener aiand make polici decis around itrequir new interdisciplinari scientif inquiri cultur econom law algorithm interact technolog creativ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2852130402848246,0.0,0.10048270229749404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08294334642440165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10683408443296431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22431164163734138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12759566095896738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13992925894624564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16297129823748596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12938409460996284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14245823533209218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14245823533209218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.327700277266444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11576420258623941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08850788973878317,0.2220557332675537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996589458637132,0.12759566095896738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12938409460996284,0.10993358780139968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227009851549535,0.0,0.0,0.11705049662268453,0.15129817971630927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993358780139968,0.0,0.10683408443296431,0.11576420258623941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16089760925763058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18595167281740776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039763559005552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15129817971630927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07304927591375533,0.15479183331937046,0.22904304047367605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12589044100690164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14517470889726594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08243067207242107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13992925894624564,0.0,0.21774206340913813,0.15129817971630927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23152840517247883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993358780139968,0.12120462969184734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936610081078957,0.0
Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT: A Framework for Applying Generative AI in Education,"Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, have the potential to revolutionize education. This study explores the potential benefits and challenges of using ChatGPT in education (or “educative AI”). Design/Approach/Methods This paper proposes a theoretical framework called “IDEE” for educative AI such as using ChatGPT and other generative AI in education, which includes identifying the desired outcomes, determining the appropriate level of automation, ensuring ethical considerations, and evaluating effectiveness.

Towards Generalist Biomedical AI,"Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.",Artificial

Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality,"The public release of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked tremendous interest in how humans will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to accomplish a variety of tasks. In our study conducted with Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm, we examine the performance implications of AI on realistic, complex, and knowledge-intensive tasks. The pre-registered experiment involved 758 consultants comprising about 7% of the individual contributor-level consultants at the company. After establishing a performance baseline on a similar task, subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: no AI access, GPT-4 AI access, or GPT-4 AI access with a prompt engineering overview. We suggest that the capabilities of AI create a “jagged technological frontier” where some tasks are easily done by AI, while others, though seemingly similar in difficulty level, are outside the current capability of AI. For each one of a set of 18 realistic consulting tasks within the frontier of AI capabilities, consultants using AI were significantly more productive (they completed 12.2% more tasks on average, and completed tasks 25.1% more quickly), and produced significantly higher quality results (more than 40% higher quality compared to a control group). Consultants across the skills distribution benefited significantly from having AI augmentation, with those below the average performance threshold increasing by 43% and those above increasing by 17% compared to their own scores. For a task selected to be outside the frontier, however, consultants using AI were 19 percentage points less likely to produce correct solutions compared to those without AI. Further, our analysis shows the emergence of two distinctive patterns of successful AI use by humans along a spectrum of humanAI integration. One set of consultants acted as “Centaurs,” like the mythical halfhorse/half-human creature, dividing and delegating their solution-creation activities to the AI or to themselves. Another set of consultants acted more like “Cyborgs,” completely integrating their task flow with the AI and continually interacting with the technology.",Artificial Intelligence,navig jag technolog

International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening,"Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful1. Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening. An artificial intelligence (AI) system performs as well as or better than radiologists at detecting breast cancer from mammograms, and using a combination of AI and human inputs could help to improve screening efficiency.",Artificial Intelligence,intern evalu ai system breast cancer screen,screen mammographi aim identifi breast cancer earlier stage diseas treatment successful1 despit exist screen

Teachers’ AI digital competencies and twenty-first century skills in the post-pandemic world,"The pandemic has catalyzed a significant shift to online/blended teaching and learning where teachers apply emerging technologies to enhance their students’ learning outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has gained its popularity in online learning environments during the pandemic to assist students’ learning. However, many of these AI tools are new to teachers. They may not have rich technical knowledge to use AI educational applications to facilitate their teaching, not to mention developing students’ AI digital capabilities. As such, there is a growing need for teachers to equip themselves with adequate digital competencies so as to use and teach AI in their teaching environments. There are few existing frameworks informing teachers of necessary AI competencies. This study first explores the opportunities and challenges of employing AI systems and how they can enhance teaching, learning and assessment. Then, aligning with generic digital competency frameworks, the DigCompEdu framework and P21’s framework for twenty-first century learning were adapted and revised to accommodate AI technologies. Recommendations are proposed to support educators and researchers to promote AI education in their classrooms and academia.",Artificial Intelligence,teacher ai digit compet twentyfirst centuri skill postpandem world,pandem catalyz signific shift onlineblend teach learn teacher appli emerg technolog enhanc student learn outcom artifici intellig ai technolog gain popular onlin learn environ pandem assist student learn howev mani ai tool new teacher may rich technic knowledg use ai educ applic facilit teach mention develop student ai digit capabl grow need teacher equip adequ digit compet use teach ai teach environ exist framework inform teacher necessari ai compet studi first explor opportun challeng employ ai system enhanc teach learn assess align gener digit compet framework digcompedu framework p21 framework twentyfirst centuri learn adapt revis accommod ai technolog recommend propos support educ research promot ai educ classroom academia,teacher ai digit compet twentyfirst centuri skill postpandem world pandem catalyz signific shift onlineblend teach learn teacher appli emerg technolog enhanc student learn outcom artifici intellig ai technolog gain popular onlin learn environ pandem assist student learn howev mani ai tool new teacher may rich technic knowledg use ai educ applic facilit teach mention develop student ai digit capabl grow need teacher equip adequ digit compet use teach ai teach environ exist framework inform teacher necessari ai compet studi first explor opportun challeng employ ai system enhanc teach learn assess align gener digit compet framework digcompedu framework p21 framework twentyfirst centuri learn adapt revis accommod ai technolog recommend propos support educ research promot ai educ classroom academia,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07264670143280329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4935776534120795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05495726023643614,0.04306147669834956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05546476764827239,0.0,0.06370234432161906,0.07395966338098153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05822763938237493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04445117423475756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03598123325702253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26143282255459116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18877645629952852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05883182981383304,0.06717199649355915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10796225664398391,0.0,0.12435819913962658,0.07536996774138047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05173967002891305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06010099335350428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06217909956981329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22829571429412399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07264670143280329,0.0,0.04253282047889553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04445117423475756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05305263197709131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05173967002891305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06717199649355915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2684503220271788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05546476764827239,0.06010099335350428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049734617261608986,0.0,0.0,0.04827001785697297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846093757255093,0.0,0.0,0.06717199649355915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037721262778907194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07536996774138047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03941396902534694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05652228414903139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07536996774138047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843826580856205,0.04079026015042477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052604837196914125,0.0,0.031405024632061955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3768498387069023,0.4230468786275465,0.0,0.06814812840800333,0.0,0.1283859387531865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05652228414903139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05816606261027603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"AI in teacher education: Unlocking new dimensions in teaching support, inclusive learning, and digital literacy","AI can positively influence teaching by offering support for classroom management, creating inclusive learning environments, enhancing digital skills, personalizing teaching methods, and strengthening teacher‐student relationships.This quantitative research study investigates the opportunities, difficulties, and consequences of incorporating AI into teacher education.Data were collected through structured questionnaires from 202 college students and 68 staff members.

A systematic review of Green AI,"With the ever‐growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)‐based systems, the carbon footprint of AI is no longer negligible. AI researchers and practitioners are therefore urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models they design and use. This led in recent years to the appearance of researches tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI. Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this article, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm‐agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115%, with savings over 50% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.",Artificial

AI Art and its Impact on Artists,"The last 3 years have resulted in machine learning (ML)-based image generators with the ability to output consistently higher quality images based on natural language prompts as inputs. As a result, many popular commercial “generative AI Art” products have entered the market, making generative AI an estimated $48B industry [125]. However, many professional artists have spoken up about the harms they have experienced due to the proliferation of large scale image generators trained on image/text pairs from the Internet. In this paper, we review some of these harms which include reputational damage, economic loss, plagiarism and copyright infringement. To guard against these issues while reaping the potential benefits of image generators, we provide recommendations such as regulation that forces organizations to disclose their training data, and tools that help artists prevent using their content as training data without their consent.",Artificial Intelligence,ai art impact artist,last 3 year result machin learn mlbase imag gener abil output consist higher qualiti imag base natur languag prompt input result mani popular commerci gener ai art product enter market make gener ai estim 48b industri 125 howev mani profession artist spoken harm experienc due prolifer larg scale imag gener train imagetext pair internet paper review harm includ reput damag econom loss plagiar copyright infring guard issu reap potenti benefit imag gener provid recommend regul forc organ disclos train data tool help artist prevent use content train data without consent,ai art impact artist last 3 year result machin learn mlbase imag gener abil output consist higher qualiti imag base natur languag prompt input result mani popular commerci gener ai art product enter market make gener ai estim 48b industri 125 howev mani profession artist spoken harm experienc due prolifer larg scale imag gener train imagetext pair internet paper review harm includ reput damag econom loss plagiar copyright infring guard issu reap potenti benefit imag gener provid recommend regul forc organ disclos train data tool help artist prevent use content train data without consent,0.1203872364455858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26157922918950943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06592880775976238,0.0,0.0,0.10984263451915471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12412644187246287,0.0,0.13314499369746657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416410210442688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984957393921473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387610509969863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3756822700276174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10617155109740584,0.0,0.13065361721418153,0.0,0.07852532634271472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32469518998066427,0.10182768552102658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08654027534084285,0.0,0.0,0.09798141567873005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387610509969863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12616453241403397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10392950726277905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11866284831737899,0.10082408269415104,0.0,0.0,0.07903859124418788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12833420119804295,0.0,0.10984263451915471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10082408269415104,0.0,0.1959628313574601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11702261091653367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13065361721418153,0.13314499369746657,0.05652112837214851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984957393921473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10503184201973109,0.12616453241403397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14196520749569083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07752172351583919,0.0,0.09708487726727394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13314499369746657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494668915923458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13256166798461425,0.10503184201973109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13314499369746657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984957393921473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3257216180982065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05137669732210634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203872364455858,0.0,0.111161164220724
Can AI Help in Screening Viral and COVID-19 Pneumonia?,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, which has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions of people worldwide. Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.",Artificial Intelligence,ai help screen viral covid19

"Democratising AI: Multiple Meanings, Goals, and Methods","Numerous parties are calling for “the democratisation of AI”, but the phrase is used to refer to a variety of goals, the pursuit of which sometimes conflict. This paper identifies four kinds of “AI democratisation” that are commonly discussed: (1) the democratisation of AI use, (2) the democratisation of AI development, (3) the democratisation of AI profits, and (4) the democratisation of AI governance. Numerous goals and methods of achieving each form of democratisation are discussed. The main takeaway from this paper is that AI democratisation is a multifarious and sometimes conflicting concept that should not be conflated with improving AI accessibility. If we want to move beyond ambiguous commitments to “democratising AI”, to productive discussions of concrete policies and trade-offs, then we need to recognise the principal role of the democratisation of AI governance in navigating tradeoffs and risks across decisions around use, development, and profits.",Artificial Intelligence,democratis ai multipl mean goal method,numer parti call democratis ai phrase use refer varieti goal pursuit sometim conflict paper identifi four kind ai democratis commonli discuss 1 democratis ai use 2 democratis ai develop 3 democratis ai profit 4 democratis ai govern numer goal method achiev form democratis discuss main takeaway paper ai democratis multifari sometim conflict concept conflat improv ai access want move beyond ambigu commit democratis ai product discuss concret polici tradeoff need recognis princip role democratis ai govern navig tradeoff risk across decis around use develop profit,democratis ai multipl mean goal method numer parti call democratis ai phrase use refer varieti goal pursuit sometim conflict paper identifi four kind ai democratis commonli discuss 1 democratis ai use 2 democratis ai develop 3 democratis ai profit 4 democratis ai govern numer goal method achiev form democratis discuss main takeaway paper ai democratis multifari sometim conflict concept conflat improv ai access want move beyond ambigu commit democratis ai product discuss concret polici tradeoff need recognis princip role democratis ai govern navig tradeoff risk across decis around use develop profit,0.0,0.0,0.08926043483864632,0.0,0.0,0.07681736504228871,0.0853510836809939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7794042033820093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10617187703874856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09509503465652945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642792606321302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330482585861729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.236679638987236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10428707080591781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.289283778189639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07551622129137969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06181636854636845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09509503465652945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11276014823277647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11779917947404435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642792606321302,0.0,0.0,0.07139591267835071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21234375407749712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09186051514795278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11276014823277647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0853510836809939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10819642196357024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09930625468363709,0.0,0.10086775708732569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252493541406736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
In Search of Verifiability: Explanations Rarely Enable Complementary Performance in AI-Advised Decision Making,"The current literature on AI‐advised decision making—involving explainable AI systems advising human decision makers—presents a series of inconclusive and confounding results. To synthesize these findings, we propose a simple theory that elucidates the frequent failure of AI explanations to engender appropriate reliance and complementary decision making performance. In contrast to other common desiderata, for example, interpretability or spelling out the AI's reasoning process, we argue that explanations are only useful to the extent that they allow a human decision maker to verify the correctness of the AI's prediction. Prior studies find in many decision making contexts that AI explanations do not facilitate such verification. Moreover, most tasks fundamentally do not allow easy verification, regardless of explanation method, limiting the potential benefit of any type of explanation. We also compare the objective of complementary performance with that of appropriate reliance, decomposing the latter into the notions of outcome‐graded and strategy‐graded reliance.",Artificial Intelligence,search verifi explan rare enabl complementari perform aiadvis decis make,current literatur aiadvis decis makinginvolv explain ai system advis human decis makerspres seri inconclus confound result synthes find propos simpl theori elucid frequent failur ai explan engend appropri relianc complementari decis make perform contrast common desiderata exampl interpret spell ai reason process argu explan use extent allow human decis maker verifi correct ai predict prior studi find mani decis make context ai explan facilit verif moreov task fundament allow easi verif regardless explan method limit potenti benefit type explan also compar object complementari perform appropri relianc decompos latter notion outcomegrad strategygrad relianc,search verifi explan rare enabl complementari perform aiadvis decis make current literatur aiadvis decis makinginvolv explain ai system advis human decis makerspres seri inconclus confound result synthes find propos simpl theori elucid frequent failur ai explan engend appropri relianc complementari decis make perform contrast common desiderata exampl interpret spell ai reason process argu explan use extent allow human decis maker verifi correct ai predict prior studi find mani decis make context ai explan facilit verif moreov task fundament allow easi verif regardless explan method limit potenti benefit type explan also compar object complementari perform appropri relianc decompos latter notion outcomegrad strategygrad relianc,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27740717317978814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16055837338906204,0.0,0.04723155707342169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16944178529356804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06989347318820227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165975888898223,0.0,0.0,0.06479351700672713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165975888898223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09033324325471574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06479351700672713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45303494277680395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716057023287975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313561607181409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09033324325471574,0.630963976279785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643312178737926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13661639322646468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13090353447189854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829442083104239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06479351700672713,0.0,0.06830819661323234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19246475700507343,0.0,0.062346114326757136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04612006320070382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08027918669453102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07446213170608058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604423314639518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06353483371483531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775963742164575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04263001393027848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04240122624649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313561607181409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04217485964181928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045850984878970484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035301351455425165,0.0,0.0,0.06613091775459375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643312178737926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08027918669453102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03269127540959363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14892426341216117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Habitat: A Platform for Embodied AI Research,"We present Habitat, a platform for research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI). Habitat enables training embodied agents (virtual robots) in highly efficient photorealistic 3D simulation. Specifically, Habitat consists of: (i) Habitat-Sim: a flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling. Habitat-Sim is fast -- when rendering a scene from Matterport3D, it achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU. (ii) Habitat-API: a modular high-level library for end-to-end development of embodied AI algorithms -- defining tasks (e.g., navigation, instruction following, question answering), configuring, training, and benchmarking embodied agents. These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or 'merely' impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works and find evidence for the opposite conclusion -- that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations, and (2) we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test} x {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets. We hope that our open-source platform and these findings will advance research in embodied AI.",Artificial Intelligence,habitat platform embodi ai research,present habitat platform research embodi

"AI-Based Modeling: Techniques, Applications and Research Issues Towards Automation, Intelligent and Smart Systems","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a leading technology of the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0 or 4IR), with the capability of incorporating human behavior and intelligence into machines or systems. Thus, AI-based modeling is the key to build automated, intelligent, and smart systems according to today’s needs. To solve real-world issues, various types of AI such as analytical, functional, interactive, textual, and visual AI can be applied to enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. However, developing an effective AI model is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature and variation in real-world problems and data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on “AI-based Modeling” with the principles and capabilities of potential AI techniques that can play an important role in developing intelligent and smart systems in various real-world application areas including business, finance, healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, cybersecurity and many more. We also emphasize and highlight the research issues within the scope of our study. Overall, the goal of this paper is to provide a broad overview of AI-based modeling that can be used as a reference guide by academics and industry people as well as decision-makers in various real-world scenarios and application domains.",Artificial Intelligence,aibas model techniqu applic research issu toward autom intellig smart system,artifici intellig ai lead technolog current age

"Advances, challenges and opportunities in creating data for trustworthy AI","As artificial intelligence (AI) transitions from research to deployment, creating the appropriate datasets and data pipelines to develop and evaluate AI models is increasingly the biggest challenge. Automated AI model builders that are publicly available can now achieve top performance in many applications. In contrast, the design and sculpting of the data used to develop AI often rely on bespoke manual work, and they critically affect the trustworthiness of the model. This Perspective discusses key considerations for each stage of the data-for-AI pipeline—starting from data design to data sculpting (for example, cleaning, valuation and annotation) and data evaluation—to make AI more reliable. We highlight technical advances that help to make the data-for-AI pipeline more scalable and rigorous. Furthermore, we discuss how recent data regulations and policies can impact AI. It has become rapidly clear in the past few years that the creation, use and maintenance of high-quality annotated datasets for robust and reliable AI applications requires careful attention. This Perspective discusses challenges, considerations and best practices for various stages in the data-to-AI pipeline, to encourage a more data-centric approach.",Artificial Intelligence,advanc challeng opportun creat data trustworthi ai,artifici intellig ai transit research deploy creat appropri dataset data pipelin develop evalu ai model increasingli biggest challeng autom ai model builder publicli avail achiev top perform mani applic contrast design sculpt data use develop ai often reli bespok manual work critic affect trustworthi model perspect discuss key consider stage dataforai pipelinestart data design data sculpt exampl clean valuat annot data evaluationto make ai reliabl highlight technic advanc help make dataforai pipelin scalabl rigor furthermor discuss recent data regul polici impact ai becom rapidli clear past year creation use mainten highqual annot dataset robust reliabl ai applic requir care attent perspect discuss challeng consider best practic variou stage datatoai pipelin encourag datacentr approach,advanc challeng opportun creat data trustworthi ai artifici intellig ai transit research deploy creat appropri dataset data pipelin develop evalu ai model increasingli biggest challeng autom ai model builder publicli avail achiev top perform mani applic contrast design sculpt data use develop ai often reli bespok manual work critic affect trustworthi model perspect discuss key consider stage dataforai pipelinestart data design data sculpt exampl clean valuat annot data evaluationto make ai reliabl highlight technic advanc help make dataforai pipelin scalabl rigor furthermor discuss recent data regul polici impact ai becom rapidli clear past year creation use mainten highqual annot dataset robust reliabl ai applic requir care attent perspect discuss challeng consider best practic variou stage datatoai pipelin encourag datacentr approach,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06932617791748673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14788365777402432,0.0,0.0,0.09252587296695117,0.0,0.0,0.511561552578662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157614067338197,0.061639333891285286,0.09764516649266285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185708888819037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962196342880385,0.0,0.08152278269293547,0.0,0.08055580640145135,0.0,0.0,0.09103118897822364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17276545707863802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18505174593390233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17164283851805773,0.10411368792115482,0.08252923815227176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36356578225686176,0.17404865565988664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357853416983382,0.0,0.11747084870627593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09323059614537527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2135987709659507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06394519407233275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581805407370826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0778635267898001,0.0,0.0,0.09252587296695117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07467784578409084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06703105820058451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08055580640145135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14788365777402432,0.0,0.07185708888819037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1623306906923162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09103118897822364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08702432782994332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061639333891285286,0.18823410621295084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10176384068998172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06346644631023986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07467784578409084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10961523305816266,0.0,0.15405538603052785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05993833292405243,0.05106256089723209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09252587296695117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20352768137996344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828895041319505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535673741153476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055917158677194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0629968181099508,0.08152278269293547
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Assisted Biomedical Systems for Intelligent Healthcare,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a modern approach based on computer science that develops programs and algorithms to make devices intelligent and efficient for performing tasks that usually require skilled human intelligence. AI involves various subsets, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), conventional neural networks, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition, with unique capabilities and functionalities that can improve the performances of modern medical sciences. Such intelligent systems simplify human intervention in clinical diagnosis, medical imaging, and decision-making ability. In the same era, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) emerges as a next-generation bio-analytical tool that combines network-linked biomedical devices with a software application for advancing human health. In this review, we discuss the importance of AI in improving the capabilities of IoMT and point-of-care (POC) devices used in advanced healthcare sectors such as cardiac measurement, cancer diagnosis, and diabetes management. The role of AI in supporting advanced robotic surgeries developed for advanced biomedical applications is also discussed in this article. The position and importance of AI in improving the functionality, detection accuracy, decision-making ability of IoMT devices, and evaluation of associated risks assessment is discussed carefully and critically in this review. This review also encompasses the technological and engineering challenges and prospects for AI-based cloud-integrated personalized IoMT devices for designing efficient POC biomedical systems suitable for next-generation intelligent healthcare.",Artificial Intelligence,artifici intellig ai internet medic thing iomt assist biomed system intellig healthcar,artifici intellig ai modern approach base

"Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work”: Data Cascades in High-Stakes AI","AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and conservation. Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection, wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India, East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative, downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible, delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer and more robust systems for all.",Artificial Intelligence,everyon want model work data work data cascad highstak ai,ai model increasingli appli highstak domain like health conserv data qualiti carri elev signific highstak ai due heighten downstream impact impact predict like cancer detect wildlif poach loan alloc paradox data undervalu deglamoris aspect ai paper report data practic highstak ai interview 53 ai practition india east west african countri usa defin identifi present empir evid data cascadescompound event caus neg downstream effect data issuestrigg convent aiml practic undervalu data qualiti data cascad pervas 92 preval invis delay often avoid discuss hci opportun design incentiv data excel firstclass citizen ai result safer robust system,everyon want model work data work data cascad highstak ai ai model increasingli appli highstak domain like health conserv data qualiti carri elev signific highstak ai due heighten downstream impact impact predict like cancer detect wildlif poach loan alloc paradox data undervalu deglamoris aspect ai paper report data practic highstak ai interview 53 ai practition india east west african countri usa defin identifi present empir evid data cascadescompound event caus neg downstream effect data issuestrigg convent aiml practic undervalu data qualiti data cascad pervas 92 preval invis delay often avoid discuss hci opportun design incentiv data excel firstclass citizen ai result safer robust system,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5172077502890398,0.0,0.0,0.12030035382014362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226906642736942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874953154855696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10201532752504068,0.0,0.09916416667543923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10691096893879411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6001282021015308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11282616447887209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06786708330618131,0.0,0.07621365157403855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226906642736942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09916416667543923,0.0846118516330329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06406306329794954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11282616447887209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07874757269804045,0.0,0.0,0.1725761799381393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1907202933344149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12504561065939634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10518390483912073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10055409272247237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047895620775179115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466672845670592,0.11071498894702587,0.10355558549329205,0.0621504100535456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16453813285473884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874953154855696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05616592911337644,0.0,0.0,0.10691096893879411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846118516330329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047012206330754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14558200097396476,0.0
Explainable AI: A Review of Machine Learning Interpretability Methods,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread industrial adoption, with machine learning systems demonstrating superhuman performance in a significant number of tasks. However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into “black box” approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.",Artificial Intelligence,explain ai review machin learn interpret method,recent advanc artifici intellig ai led widespread industri adopt machin learn system demonstr superhuman perform signific number task howev surg perform often achiev increas model complex turn system black box approach caus uncertainti regard way oper ultim way come decis ambigu made problemat machin learn system adopt sensit yet critic domain valu could immens healthcar result scientif interest field explain artifici intellig xai field concern develop new method explain interpret machin learn model tremend reignit recent year studi focus machin learn interpret method specif literatur review taxonomi method present well link program implement hope survey would serv refer point theorist practition,explain ai review machin learn interpret method recent advanc artifici intellig ai led widespread industri adopt machin learn system demonstr superhuman perform signific number task howev surg perform often achiev increas model complex turn system black box approach caus uncertainti regard way oper ultim way come decis ambigu made problemat machin learn system adopt sensit yet critic domain valu could immens healthcar result scientif interest field explain artifici intellig xai field concern develop new method explain interpret machin learn model tremend reignit recent year studi focus machin learn interpret method specif literatur review taxonomi method present well link program implement hope survey would serv refer point theorist practition,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07102613287105634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17831652218937155,0.07575496473364834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310264026397849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06315079888374366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14723820918483257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879258558683196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07728630003544382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09181959360626386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964249078800958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455294682085383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08915826109468578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07575496473364834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047758357004410466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879258558683196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3200000138815551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458909668608286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09326337493281425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10425920319620706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05900061938411937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06601340175559593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06551320131989245,0.07361910459241629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13734946853434798,0.0,0.0964249078800958,0.0,0.31277760958862116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29693132495258734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065920908290956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41265562164803665,0.09181959360626386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21783668754633467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11087414646249678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06406941999334206,0.0,0.0,0.08157783019250797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09326337493281425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06270372001665842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263015977674873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09479471023460972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816761928207547,0.0,0.05510688164617511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08157783019250797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15301805916657055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10003953452877325,0.10003953452877325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04980062409132445,0.15783299536185977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07502275994298563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07361910459241629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05414144069635396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455294682085383,0.12505288804832088,0.0,0.0,0.07808824982182568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09479471023460972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17125594548657172,0.07575496473364834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08352181195476183
Reporting guideline for the early stage clinical evaluation of decision support systems driven by artificial intelligence: DECIDE-AI,"A growing number of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems are showing promising performance in preclinical, in silico, evaluation, but few have yet demonstrated real benefit to patient care. Early stage clinical evaluation is important to assess an AI system’s actual clinical performance at small scale, ensure its safety, evaluate the human factors surrounding its use, and pave the way to further large scale trials. However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multistakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyse expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 predefined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation & Elaboration (E&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second, 16 in the consensus meeting, and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and 10 generic reporting items, with an E&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we have developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.",Artificial

Multimodal biomedical AI,"The increasing availability of biomedical data from large biobanks, electronic health records, medical imaging, wearable and ambient biosensors, and the lower cost of genome and microbiome sequencing have set the stage for the development of multimodal artificial intelligence solutions that capture the complexity of human health and disease. In this Review, we outline the key applications enabled, along with the technical and analytical challenges.

Opportunities and Adoption Challenges of AI in the Construction Industry: A PRISMA Review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with a range of capabilities, which are beginning to become apparent in all industries nowadays. The increased popularity of AI in the construction industry, however, is rather limited in comparison to other industry sectors. Moreover, despite AI being a hot topic in built environment research, there are limited review studies that investigate the reasons for the low-level AI adoption in the construction industry. This study aims to reduce this gap by identifying the adoption challenges of AI, along with the opportunities offered, for the construction industry. To achieve the aim, the study adopts a systematic literature review approach using the PRISMA protocol. In addition, the systematic review of the literature focuses on the planning, design, and construction stages of the construction project lifecycle. The results of the review reveal that (a) AI is particularly beneficial in the planning stage as the success of construction projects depends on accurate events, risks, and cost forecasting; (b) the major opportunity in adopting AI is to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks by using big data analytics and improving the work processes; and (c) the biggest challenge to incorporate AI on a construction site is the fragmented nature of the industry, which has resulted in issues of data acquisition and retention. The findings of the study inform a range of parties that operate in the construction industry concerning the opportunities and challenges of AI adaptability and help increase the market acceptance of AI practices",Artificial Intelligence,opportun adopt challeng ai construct industri prisma review,artifici intellig ai power technolog rang capabl begin becom appar industri nowaday increas popular ai

The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines,"In the past five years, private companies, research institutions and public sector organizations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). However, despite an apparent agreement that AI should be ‘ethical’, there is debate about both what constitutes ‘ethical AI’ and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies. As AI technology develops rapidly, it is widely recognized that ethical guidelines are required for safe and fair implementation in society. But is it possible to agree on what is ‘ethical AI’? A detailed analysis of 84 AI ethics reports around the world, from national and international organizations, companies and institutes, explores this question, finding a convergence around core principles but substantial divergence on practical implementation.",Artificial Intelligence,global landscap ai ethic guidelin,past five year privat compani research institut public sector organ issu principl guidelin ethic artifici intellig ai howev despit appar agreement ai ethic debat constitut ethic ai ethic requir technic standard best practic need realiz investig whether global agreement question emerg map analys current corpu principl guidelin ethic ai result reveal global converg emerg around five ethic principl transpar justic fair nonmalefic respons privaci substant diverg relat principl interpret deem import issu domain actor pertain implement find highlight import integr guidelinedevelop effort substant ethic analysi adequ implement strategi ai technolog develop rapidli wide recogn ethic guidelin requir safe fair implement societi possibl agre ethic ai detail analysi 84 ai ethic report around world nation intern organ compani institut explor question find converg around core principl substanti diverg practic implement,global landscap ai ethic guidelin past five year privat compani research institut public sector organ issu principl guidelin ethic artifici intellig ai howev despit appar agreement ai ethic debat constitut ethic ai ethic requir technic standard best practic need realiz investig whether global agreement question emerg map analys current corpu principl guidelin ethic ai result reveal global converg emerg around five ethic principl transpar justic fair nonmalefic respons privaci substant diverg relat principl interpret deem import issu domain actor pertain implement find highlight import integr guidelinedevelop effort substant ethic analysi adequ implement strategi ai technolog develop rapidli wide recogn ethic guidelin requir safe fair implement societi possibl agre ethic ai detail analysi 84 ai ethic report around world nation intern organ compani institut explor question find converg around core principl substanti diverg practic implement,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412948109166901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08405826050378437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047940372847601054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06073261814386837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234596312407645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06073261814386837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04982227676820553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06172981562038225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031099990336151555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05725685386434178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06514521755408434,0.0,0.0,0.10170131332623071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7165973930949278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05194764446052688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050497035636488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2036791306424629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06172981562038225,0.03842089233730579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17195031700658614,0.08944124990939904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04546842285178071,0.04472062495469952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06789304354748764,0.0,0.0,0.05194764446052688,0.0,0.0,0.10170131332623071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042987579251646535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12785247242544828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06073261814386837,0.0,0.0,0.0846848973845697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3086490781019113,0.06392623621272414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06172981562038225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13029043510816868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06073261814386837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0537438331231846,0.0,0.0,0.06279139173398164,0.0,0.0799772457443643,0.03406703842088097,0.0,0.0,0.05725685386434178,0.0324299038978974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06514521755408434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06073261814386837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05312305300613489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05890309872861487,0.0,0.036989666492717774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05438896368254627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05438896368254627
A Survey on the Convergence of Edge Computing and AI for UAVs: Opportunities and Challenges,"The latest 5G mobile networks have enabled many exciting Internet of Things (IoT) applications that employ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/drones). The success of most UAV-based IoT applications is heavily dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, for instance, computer vision and path planning. These AI methods must process data and provide decisions while ensuring low latency and low energy consumption. However, the existing cloud-based AI paradigm finds it difficult to meet these strict UAV requirements. Edge AI, which runs AI on-device or on edge servers close to users, can be suitable for improving UAV-based IoT services. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of edge AI on key UAV technical aspects (i.e., autonomous navigation, formation control, power management, security and privacy, computer vision, and communication) and applications (i.e., delivery systems, civil infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, search and rescue (SAR) operations, acting as aerial wireless base stations (BSs), and drone light shows). As guidance for researchers and practitioners, this article also explores UAV-based edge AI implementation challenges, lessons learned, and future research directions.",Artificial Intelligence,survey

Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI,"Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community’s programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization’s impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI’s work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.",Artificial Intelligence,queer ai case studi communityl participatori

What is AI Literacy? Competencies and Design Considerations,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated in user-facing technology, but public understanding of these technologies is often limited. There is a need for additional HCI research investigating a) what competencies users need in order to effectively interact with and critically evaluate AI and b) how to design learner-centered AI technologies that foster increased user understanding of AI. This paper takes a step towards realizing both of these goals by providing a concrete definition of AI literacy based on existing research. We synthesize a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies of AI literacy and suggest several design considerations to support AI developers and educators in creating learner-centered AI. These competencies and design considerations are organized in a conceptual framework thematically derived from the literature. This paper's contributions can be used to start a conversation about and guide future research on AI literacy within the HCI community.",Artificial Intelligence,ai literaci compet design consider,artifici intellig ai becom increasingli integr userfac technolog public understand technolog often limit need addit hci research investig compet user need order effect interact critic evalu ai b design learnercent ai technolog foster increas user understand ai paper take step toward realiz goal provid concret definit ai literaci base exist research synthes varieti interdisciplinari literatur set core compet ai literaci suggest sever design consider support ai develop educ creat learnercent ai compet design consider organ conceptu framework themat deriv literatur paper contribut use start convers guid futur research ai literaci within hci commun,ai literaci compet design consider artifici intellig ai becom increasingli integr userfac technolog public understand technolog often limit need addit hci research investig compet user need order effect interact critic evalu ai b design learnercent ai technolog foster increas user understand ai paper take step toward realiz goal provid concret definit ai literaci base exist research synthes varieti interdisciplinari literatur set core compet ai literaci suggest sever design consider support ai develop educ creat learnercent ai compet design consider organ conceptu framework themat deriv literatur paper contribut use start convers guid futur research ai literaci within hci commun,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08353152566693547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6708216735676662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753821977162981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05072245983913744,0.08450765010531956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07210386273369096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29119480448424184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08168329474757827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09549692580204058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003157927736016,0.0,0.08657789292647583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24646728332834472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048902114882322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08552206356291246,0.058163134481201854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06708216735676661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031941539228698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0775692092583714,0.0,0.0,0.0753821977162981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09129349919549655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06708216735676661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149526458955552,0.07031941539228698,0.09003157927736016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08168329474757827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834133309634725,0.0,0.16518180927059148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13518869403848655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09549692580204058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08657789292647583,0.10051862117896494,0.0,0.08696928585044891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05964149271470219,0.09706493482808062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09549692580204058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16070264413765895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07995837384844971,0.09003157927736016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09401856756854027,0.0,0.07149526458955552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10450560947014503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17448940344360556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08259090463529574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16336658949515653,0.0,0.0,0.03952676462895969,0.16336658949515653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003157927736016,0.0,0.0,0.0
"AI4People—An Ethical Framework for a Good AI Society: Opportunities, Risks, Principles, and Recommendations","This article reports the findings of AI4People, an Atomium—EISMD initiative designed to lay the foundations for a “Good AI Society”. We introduce the core opportunities and risks of AI for society; present a synthesis of five ethical principles that should undergird its development and adoption; and offer 20 concrete recommendations—to assess, to develop, to incentivise, and to support good AI—which in some cases may be undertaken directly by national or supranational policy makers, while in others may be led by other stakeholders. If adopted, these recommendations would serve as a firm foundation for the establishment of a Good AI Society.",Artificial Intelligence,ai4peoplean ethic framework good ai societi opportun risk principl recommend,articl report find ai4peopl atomiumeismd initi design lay foundat good ai societi introduc core opportun risk ai societi present synthesi five ethic principl undergird develop adopt offer 20 concret recommendationsto assess develop incentivis support good aiwhich case may undertaken directli nation supran polici maker other may led stakehold adopt recommend would serv firm foundat establish good ai societi,ai4peoplean ethic framework good ai societi opportun risk principl recommend articl report find ai4peopl atomiumeismd initi design lay foundat good ai societi introduc core opportun risk ai societi present synthesi five ethic principl undergird develop adopt offer 20 concret recommendationsto assess develop incentivis support good aiwhich case may undertaken directli nation supran polici maker other may led stakehold adopt recommend would serv firm foundat establish good ai societi,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20809393517692043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3058134984085467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412864282141711,0.0,0.0,0.0986726031818329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0986726031818329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10883760214344652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07022453314327867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11146723056966819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0986726031818329,0.0,0.0,0.2334906508691504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412864282141711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884054294412059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.458243262094631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11062465802090211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08755095238897523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18618848430643056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055589602485857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20809393517692043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12166964454627552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06430928394230928,0.0,0.22124931604180423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2334906508691504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11252708545163162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21430544209000862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4669813017383008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08148297023370998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Intelligent Clinical Documentation: Harnessing Generative AI for Patient-Centric Clinical Note Generation,"Comprehensive clinical documentation is crucial for effective healthcare delivery, yet it poses a significant burden on healthcare professionals, leading to burnout, increased medical errors, and compromised patient safety. This paper explores the potential of generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to streamline the clinical documentation process, specifically focusing on generating SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and BIRP (Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan) notes. We present a case study demonstrating the application of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to transcribe patient-clinician interactions, coupled with advanced prompting techniques to generate draft clinical notes using large language models (LLMs). The study highlights the benefits of this approach, including time savings, improved documentation quality, and enhanced patient-centered care. Additionally, we discuss ethical considerations, such as maintaining patient confidentiality and addressing model biases, underscoring the need for responsible deployment of generative AI in healthcare settings. The findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize clinical documentation practices, alleviating administrative burdens and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care.",Artificial Intelligence,intellig clinic document har gener ai patientcentr clinic note gener,comprehens clinic document crucial effect healthcar deliveri yet pose signific burden

Trust in AI and Its Role in the Acceptance of AI Technologies,"Abstract As AI-enhanced technologies become common in a variety of domains, there is an increasing need to define and examine the trust that users have in such technologies. Given the progress in the development of AI, a correspondingly sophisticated understanding of trust in the technology is required. This paper addresses this need by explaining the role of trust in the intention to use AI technologies. Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis confirmed that trust had a significant effect the on intention to use AI, which operated through perceived usefulness and participants’ attitude toward voice assistants. In Study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S. population, different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory factor analysis, which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and functionality trust. The results of the path analyses from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, confirming the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use. Further, both dimensions of trust shared a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact on usage intention than human-like trust. Overall, the role of trust in the acceptance of AI technologies was significant across both studies.

Mobile ad hoc network access authentication mechanism based on rotation election and two-factor aggregation,"With the continuous development and progress of computer network communication technology, mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) with strong indestructibility and no fixed infrastructure have become one of the new hot research areas in the academic community. However, due to the open wireless channel and unpredictable changes of network topology, mobile ad hoc networks are susceptible to security threats such as identity spoofing, identity tracing, and DoS attacks, and face security problems that cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary to design a trusted access authentication scheme to authenticate the identity of unknown nodes and ensure the security of connected nodes. In this paper, the Certificate Authority rotation election algorithm based on improved DPoS and access authentication mechanism based on dual identity factor aggregation are proposed, which improve the authentication efficiency and the anti-attack ability of the authentication system, and ensure the security and stability of the network. At the same time, the authentication information is uploaded to the blockchain to ensure the security and immutability of the data. The safety analysis and performance simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme has high safety and good performance.",Networking,mobil ad hoc network access authent mechan base rotat elect twofactor aggreg,continu develop progress comput network commun technolog mobil ad hoc network manet strong indestruct fix infrastructur becom one new hot research area academ commun howev due open wireless channel unpredict chang network topolog mobil ad hoc network suscept secur threat ident spoof ident trace do attack face secur problem ignor therefor necessari design trust access authent scheme authent ident unknown node ensur secur connect node paper certif author rotat elect algorithm base improv dpo access authent mechan base dual ident factor aggreg propos improv authent effici antiattack abil authent system ensur secur stabil network time authent inform upload blockchain ensur secur immut data safeti analysi perform simul experi show propos scheme high safeti good perform,mobil ad hoc network access authent mechan base rotat elect twofactor aggreg continu develop progress comput network commun technolog mobil ad hoc network manet strong indestruct fix infrastructur becom one new hot research area academ commun howev due open wireless channel unpredict chang network topolog mobil ad hoc network suscept secur threat ident spoof ident trace do attack face secur problem ignor therefor necessari design trust access authent scheme authent ident unknown node ensur secur connect node paper certif author rotat elect algorithm base improv dpo access authent mechan base dual ident factor aggreg propos improv authent effici antiattack abil authent system ensur secur stabil network time authent inform upload blockchain ensur secur immut data safeti analysi perform simul experi show propos scheme high safeti good perform,0.07289499866445881,0.08061987652771703,0.19953058811662777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810057143047635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055801062829256204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05201277113952084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055801062829256204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428733895679267,0.6017238821519783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11976054510818841,0.06651019603887592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10007023508198085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07770692061001075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11349604537817132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052400515550034825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06900588474746354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911133716105574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0428821291388367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04849438870595666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038487512591882274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06045935411297265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0544584246748548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19953058811662777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058256562055746926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06900588474746354,0.07289499866445881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911133716105574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500165667221465,0.0,0.0,0.047547428846127206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09212186335104618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05674802268908566,0.07515910391885214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643158090248946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.258773226855316,0.0,0.05163227471415367,0.1554138412200215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057741193615457556,0.0,0.06900588474746354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03422379065129326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10178395236674712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05626903668219873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806974883720274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04215935619335763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16123975305543406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14799117837224754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2966408805418133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05534360613804066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05626903668219873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08810526967496486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03359254732434589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04577622820844157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06730857154505665,0.08224922316925276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05279578944688204,0.0,0.0,0.07911133716105574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08810526967496486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08596055459313975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
INCS: Intent-driven network-wide configuration synthesis based on deep reinforcement learning,"Configuring modern networks is a complex task due to the intricate low-level configuration languages and diverse routing protocols used across numerous interconnected devices. Network configuration synthesis has been proposed to solve these challenges. However, existing synthesizers encounter several limitations: (i) They cannot scale to large topologies with more than a few tens of routers. (ii) They only support specific routing protocols. (iii) They require prolonged synthesis times. (iv) They lack configuration optimization.
To address these limitations, this paper introduces INCS, an end-to-end network configuration synthesizer designed to generate configurations that comply with any hard and soft specifications. It comprises a fact base graph constructor using graph embedding techniques, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor employing a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based optimizer trained with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The graph constructor translates network topology, hard specifications, and configuration sketches into a fact base graph. The predictor then generates initial configurations, which are further optimized by the optimizer to meet predefined soft specifications.
We compare INCS with two benchmark synthesizers: NetComplete and a neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR)-based synthesizer. The evaluation shows that INCS has superior synthesis speed and specification consistency. It is 27.9x faster than the benchmarks. Even in the presence of unsatisfiable hard specifications, INCS maintains 100% specification consistency, whereas Netcomplete fails to synthesize, and the NAR-based synthesizer achieves only 90% consistency.",Networking,inc intentdriven networkwid configur synthesi base deep reinforc learn,configur modern network complex task due intric lowlevel configur languag divers rout protocol use

Adaptive and low-cost resource synchronization based on data distribution service in high dynamic networks,"In disaster-stricken areas monitoring, management, search, and rescue operations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in disaster management and emergency communication due to their high mobility. To efficiently coordinate and plan UAVs and their carried sensor and base station resources, synchronization is essential to establish consistency, laying the foundation for high-level demands. In such scenarios, synchronization relies on request–response (RR) or publish–subscribe (PS) forms of information exchange. Existing research in the field typically focuses on higher-level applications and selects either RR or PS synchronization, thereby overlooking the potential advantages that could be gained from combining both methods to meet synchronization requirements. We propose a resource synchronization method based on the Data Distribution Service (DDS) and a linear time complexity subscription mechanism tailored to specific query demands, which considers the pros and cons of the above two information exchange forms and the bottom-layer network topology. Experimental results using open-source simulation tools demonstrate that the proposed method adapts to scene requirements and decreases bandwidth by at least 21.2% and packet rate by at least 3.7% compared to different baseline methods across three topologies, while satisfying delay and query success rate requirements. Furthermore, the method maintains robust performance in the face of dynamic changes in network topology, showcasing its robustness.",Networking,adapt lowcost resourc synchron base data distribut

A congestion-aware user–cell association scheme to assist with traffic offloading in a three-tier heterogeneous network,"In this work, we aim to expand the cell range in congestion areas. To achieve this goal, we integrate UAV network into macro–micro cellular network to enhance coverage. However, the gain of deploying heterogeneous nodes is limit if there are no CRE (cell range expanding)-based method to steer users towards low-power nodes. Therefore, in order to further improve system access capacity, we propose a congestion-aware UA (user–cell association) scheme to offload queued traffic of cellular network into UAV network. To verify the superiority of proposed scheme, we utilize the low-complexity SG (stochastic-geometry) methods. Then in simulation analysis phase, we obtain five primary results: . The SG-based methods have lower computation complexity, and the convergence of derived expressions are verified. . The SG-based methods do not need the exact users’ location but the users’ density, which have improved the operability and robustness in infrastructure construction of wireless network. The congestion-aware UA scheme can prompt network to adjust association tier flexibly, which is very suitable for traffic unevenly-distributed regions.

Reliable edge-to-core optical networks: An optimal algorithm for maximal path diversity,"With the emergence of IoT applications, 5G, and edge computing, network resource allocation has shifted toward the edge, bringing services closer to the end users. These applications often require communication with the core network for purposes that include cloud storage, compute offloading, 5G-and-Beyond transport communication between centralized unit (CU), distributed unit (DU) and core network, centralized network monitoring and management, etc. As the number of these services increases, efficient and reliable connectivity between the edge and core networks is of the essence. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a well-suited technology for transferring large amounts of data by simultaneously transmitting several wavelength-multiplexed data streams over each single fiber optics link. WDM is the technology of choice in mid-haul and long-haul transmission networks, including edge-to-core networks, to offer increased transport capacity.
Optical networks are prone to failures of components such as network fiber links, sites, and transmission ports. A single network element failure alone can cause significant traffic loss due to the disruption of many active data flows. Thus, fault-tolerant and reliable network designs remain a priority. The architecture called “dual-hub and dual-spoke” is often used in metro area networks (MANs). A dual-hub, or in general a multi-hub network, consists of a set of designated destination nodes (hubs) in which the data traffic from all other nodes (the peripherals) should be directed to the hubs. Multiple hubs offer redundant connectivity to and from the core or wide area network (WAN) through geographical diversity. The routing of the connections (also known as lightpaths) between the peripheral node and the hubs has to be carefully computed to maximize path diversity across the edge-to-core network. This means that whenever possible the established redundant lightpaths must not contain a common Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG).
An algorithm is proposed to compute the most reliable set of SRLG disjoint shortest paths from any peripheral to all hubs. The proposed algorithm can also be used to evaluate the overall edge-to-core network reliability quantified through a newly introduced figure of merit.",Networking,reliabl edgetocor optic network

Secure and Efficient Authentication using Linkage for permissionless Bitcoin network,"The cryptocurrency’s permissionless and large-scale broadcasting requirements prohibit the traditional authentication implementation on the blockchain’s underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. Thus, blockchain networking implementations remain vulnerable to networking integrity threats such as spoofing or hijacking. We design Secure and Efficient Authentication using Linkage (SEAL) to build connection security for permissionless Bitcoin networking. SEAL uses the linkage between the packets for a symmetric operation, in contrast to the traditional authentication approach relying on identity-credential-based trust. To make it appropriate for cryptocurrency networking, SEAL utilizes the packet header, protects the end-to-end connection, and separates the online process and the offline process so that the real-time overhead is minimal for greater efficiency and practicality. We implement SEAL on a functioning Bitcoin node and demonstrate that SEAL operates efficiently with minimal overhead. Specifically, it reduces the hash rate by only 1.3% compared to an unsecured node. Additionally, we use a network simulator to emulate the Bitcoin Mainnet and analyze SEAL’s impact on block propagation delay. SEAL yields 2.04 times smaller delay and 1.25 times smaller delay in block propagation than HMAC and ChaCha20-Poly1305, respectively. The key advantage of SEAL is that it requires fewer hash computations and simpler mixing operations, resulting in significantly lower computational overhead compared to traditional authentication schemes based on message authentication codes (MACs).",Networking,secur effici authent use linkag permissionless bitcoin network,cryptocurr permissionless largescal broadcast requir prohibit tradit

A two-step linear programming approach for repeater placement in large-scale quantum networks,"Thanks to the applications such as Quantum Key Distribution and Distributed Quantum Computing, the deployment of quantum networks is gaining great momentum. A major component in quantum networks is repeaters, which are essential for reducing the error rate of qubit transmission for long-distance links. However, repeaters are expensive devices, so minimizing the number of repeaters placed in a quantum network while satisfying performance requirements becomes an important problem. Existing solutions typically solve this problem optimally by formulating an Integer Linear Program (ILP). However, the number of variables in their ILPs is , where is the number of nodes in a network. This incurs infeasible running time when the network scale is large. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes to solve the repeater placement problem by two steps, with each step using a linear program of a much smaller scale with  variables. Although this solution is not optimal, it dramatically reduces the time complexity, making it practical for large-scale networks. Moreover, it constructs networks that have higher node connectivity than those by existing solutions, since it deploys slightly more number of repeaters into networks. Our extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world network topologies verified our claims.",Networking,twostep linear program approach repeat placement largescal quantum network,thank applic quantum key distribut distribut quantum comput deploy quantum network gain great momentum major compon quantum network repeat essenti reduc error rate qubit transmiss longdist link howev repeat expens devic minim number repeat place quantum network satisfi perform requir becom import problem exist solut typic solv problem optim formul integ linear program ilp howev number variabl ilp number node network incur infeas run time network scale larg overcom drawback paper propos solv repeat placement problem two step step use linear program much smaller scale variabl although solut optim dramat reduc time complex make practic largescal network moreov construct network higher node connect exist solut sinc deploy slightli number repeat network extens experi synthet realworld network topolog verifi claim,twostep linear program approach repeat placement largescal quantum network thank applic quantum key distribut distribut quantum comput deploy quantum network gain great momentum major compon quantum network repeat essenti reduc error rate qubit transmiss longdist link howev repeat expens devic minim number repeat place quantum network satisfi perform requir becom import problem exist solut typic solv problem optim formul integ linear program ilp howev number variabl ilp number node network incur infeas run time network scale larg overcom drawback paper propos solv repeat placement problem two step step use linear program much smaller scale variabl although solut optim dramat reduc time complex make practic largescal network moreov construct network higher node connect exist solut sinc deploy slightli number repeat network extens experi synthet realworld network topolog verifi claim,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04319918204846116,0.047730075445256114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06237794074601971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058413844270876335,0.07164689522991656,0.0,0.049144889786979486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06471857318519933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06836605781036946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12943714637039866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06556721320829487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693996912092981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07287901672299492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10381025436556804,0.0,0.054637102164849044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419617736333656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07287901672299492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419617736333656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419617736333656,0.0,0.08918664733616796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05190512718278402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06237794074601971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057256444035588154,0.14329379045983312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06939826902661546,0.057256444035588154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07048949499462837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07164689522991656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40449289414218026,0.0,0.0,0.14575803344598984,0.0,0.24662972178177917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073646807465165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032097478469357316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047730075445256114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049144889786979486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15831918314958207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849722913363344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03784189077627033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6216312571551994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07164689522991656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561099170505994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11565274925424841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04641291480491446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512219834101199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17705990048891662,0.14575803344598984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09903121090883496,0.0,0.0,0.07419617736333656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07048949499462837,0.0,0.05901996682963887,0.0,0.07164689522991656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029176035291885505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06645533878216589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Designing the Network Intelligence Stratum for 6G networks,"As network complexity escalates, there is an increasing need for more sophisticated methods to manage and operate these networks, focusing on enhancing efficiency, reliability, and security. A wide range of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) models are being developed in response. These models are pivotal in automating decision-making, conducting predictive analyses, managing networks proactively, enhancing security, and optimizing network performance. They are foundational in shaping the future of networks, collectively forming what is known as Network Intelligence (NI). Prominent Standard-Defining Organizations (SDOs) are integrating NI into future network architectures, particularly emphasizing the closed-loop approach. However, existing methods for seamlessly integrating NI into network architectures are not yet fully effective. This paper introduces an in-depth architectural design for a Network Intelligence Stratum (NI Stratum). This stratum is supported by a novel end-to-end NI orchestrator that supports closed-loop NI operations across various network domains. The primary goal of this design is to streamline the deployment and coordination of NI throughout the entire network infrastructure, tackling issues related to scalability, conflict resolution, and effective data management. We detail exhaustive workflows for managing the NI lifecycle and demonstrate a reference implementation of the NI Stratum, focusing on its compatibility and integration with current network systems and open-source platforms such as Kubernetes and Kubeflow, as well as on its validation on real-world environments. The paper also outlines major challenges and open issues in deploying and managing NI.",Networking,design network intellig stratum 6g network,network complex escal increas need sophist method manag

Network traffic prediction based on PSO-LightGBM-TM,"Network traffic prediction is critical in wireless network management by allowing a good estimate of the traffic trend, which is also an important approach for detecting traffic anomalies in order to enhance network security. Deep-learning-based method has been widely adopted to predict network traffic matrix (TM) though with the main drawbacks in high complexity and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a traffic prediction model based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and LightGBM (PSO-LightGBM-TM), which optimizes the LightGBM parameters for each network flow by PSO so that LightGBM can adapt to each of the network traffic flow. Compared with existing commonly used deep learning models, our model has a more straightforward structure and yet outperforms existing deep learning models. Sufficient comparison tests on three real network traffic datasets, Abilene, GÉANT, and CERNET have been conducted, and the results show that our model provides more accurate results and higher prediction efficiency.",Networking,network traffic predict base psolightgbmtm,network traffic predict critic wireless network manag allow good estim traffic trend also import approach detect traffic anomali order enhanc network secur deeplearningbas method wide adopt predict network traffic matrix tm though main drawback high complex low effici paper propos traffic predict model base particl swarm optim pso lightgbm psolightgbmtm optim lightgbm paramet network flow pso lightgbm adapt network traffic flow compar exist commonli use deep learn model model straightforward structur yet outperform exist deep learn model suffici comparison test three real network traffic dataset abilen géant cernet conduct result show model provid accur result higher predict effici,network traffic predict base psolightgbmtm network traffic predict critic wireless network manag allow good estim traffic trend also import approach detect traffic anomali order enhanc network secur deeplearningbas method wide adopt predict network traffic matrix tm though main drawback high complex low effici paper propos traffic predict model base particl swarm optim pso lightgbm psolightgbmtm optim lightgbm paramet network flow pso lightgbm adapt network traffic flow compar exist commonli use deep learn model model straightforward structur yet outperform exist deep learn model suffici comparison test three real network traffic dataset abilen géant cernet conduct result show model provid accur result higher predict effici,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303204076930608,0.0,0.0,0.07677468957854741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08162826823440934,0.0,0.048025277393358656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05437951482463001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08531168469007952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658823638336161,0.0,0.06655167587436658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06869283851820711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07280902706512525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07677468957854741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15813275651176784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05819036583019863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11638073166039727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061698097218504666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08977819736294293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11827241447995848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15578073235876277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845326995447155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06945610718467275,0.0845326995447155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05913620723997924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10227570623061635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087885619425168,0.0,0.0,0.07571345837543142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06224878296192876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04689510500722886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23868590729647943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.368675341545447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12232202010644726,0.07280902706512525,0.0,0.0,0.03656908751924335,0.07906637825588392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3953318912794196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04311377347015589,0.0,0.0,0.05015644191014135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571345837543142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08576720560686793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339383286233993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05913620723997924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07280902706512525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339383286233993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571345837543142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6057076670034514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03324064814225443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07192111092268548,0.09185128193859017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Towards universal and transferable adversarial attacks against network traffic classification,"In recent years, deep learning technology has shown astonishing potential in many fields, but at the same time, it also hides serious vulnerabilities. In the field of network traffic classification, attackers exploit this vulnerability to add designed perturbations to normal traffic, causing incorrect network traffic classification to implement adversarial attacks. The existing network traffic adversarial attack methods mainly target specific models or sample application scenarios, which have many problems such as poor transferability, high time cost, and low practicality. Therefore, this article proposes a method towards universal and transferable adversarial attacks against network traffic classification, which can not only perform universal adversarial attacks on all samples in the network traffic dataset, but also achieve cross data and cross model transferable adversarial attacks, that is, it has transferable attack effects at both the network traffic data and classification model levels. This method utilizes the geometric characteristics of the network model to design the target loss function and optimize the generation of universal perturbations, resulting in biased learning of features at each layer of the network model, leading to incorrect classification results. Meanwhile, this article conducted universality and transferability adversarial attack verification experiments on standard network traffic datasets of three different classification applications, USTC-TFC2016, ISCX2016, and CICIoT2023, as well as five common network models such as LeNet5. The results show that the proposed method performs universal adversarial attacks on five network models on three datasets, USTC-TFC2016, ISCX2016, and CICIoT2023, with an average attack success rate of over 80 %, 85 %, and 88 %, respectively, and an average time cost of about 0–0.3 ms; And the method proposed in this article has shown good transferable attack performance between five network models and on three network traffic datasets, with transferable attack rates approaching 100 % across different models and datasets, which is more closely related to practical applications.",Networking,toward univers transfer adversari attack network traffic classif,recent year deep learn technolog shown astonish potenti mani field time also hide seriou vulner field network

A fault tolerant node placement algorithm for WSNs and IoT networks,"The operation of Internet of Things (IoT) Network and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be often disrupted by a number of factors, such as node faults, security attacks, as well as path disconnections. Despite any disruptions or any failures of network components the functionality and performance of the network should remain unaltered. An approach that can assist in resolving the above issues is the use of mobile nodes. In this work, we present a Fault Tolerant Node Placement Algorithm (FTNPA) that utilizes mobile nodes for addressing failures in the network. We initially propose a Mobile Fault Tolerant (MobileFT) Framework, that supplies the two main functionalities of the Fault Tolerant Node Placement Algorithm (FTNPA), which are the detection and the recovery. Then, we present two variations of the FTNPA algorithm, the Decentralized FTNPA and the Centralized FTNPA. The first variation uses a decentralized detection method, where the detection is performed by the neighboring nodes in the network, as well as a local recovery method, where a mobile node is placed in a certain position to assist the affected area. Whereas, the second variation employs a centralized detection method, where the sink is responsible for the detection, and a recovery method that creates alternatives paths of mobile nodes towards a destination node. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can significantly contribute to the detection and recovery of faults in IoT Networks and WSNs.",Networking,fault toler node placement algorithm wsn iot network,oper internet thing iot network wireless sensor network wsn often disrupt number factor node fault secur attack well path disconnect despit disrupt failur network compon function perform network remain unalt approach assist resolv issu use mobil node work present fault toler node placement algorithm ftnpa util mobil node address failur network initi propos mobil fault toler mobileft framework suppli two main function fault toler node placement algorithm ftnpa detect recoveri present two variat ftnpa algorithm decentr ftnpa central ftnpa first variat use decentr detect method detect perform neighbor node network well local recoveri method mobil node place certain posit assist affect area wherea second variat employ central detect method sink respons detect recoveri method creat altern path mobil node toward destin node simul result show propos algorithm significantli contribut detect recoveri fault iot network wsn,fault toler node placement algorithm wsn iot network oper internet thing iot network wireless sensor network wsn often disrupt number factor node fault secur attack well path disconnect despit disrupt failur network compon function perform network remain unalt approach assist resolv issu use mobil node work present fault toler node placement algorithm ftnpa util mobil node address failur network initi propos mobil fault toler mobileft framework suppli two main function fault toler node placement algorithm ftnpa detect recoveri present two variat ftnpa algorithm decentr ftnpa central ftnpa first variat use decentr detect method detect perform neighbor node network well local recoveri method mobil node place certain posit assist affect area wherea second variat employ central detect method sink respons detect recoveri method creat altern path mobil node toward destin node simul result show propos algorithm significantli contribut detect recoveri fault iot network wsn,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045831546315989916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05563690007832709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20319865546169108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03706445938455525,0.0,0.0,0.04063973109233822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152330549121716,0.0468202581703564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05563690007832709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0468202581703564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051605432889028836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23797135276119855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052328756018195484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05308918851177816,0.11980367909407079,0.0,0.36715079498321257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04843915769470739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0444620949090086,0.0,0.09072173208512363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05563690007832709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05563690007832709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18357539749160628,0.045831546315989916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061191799163868764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051605432889028836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12785268279647355,0.0,0.0,0.3208338950787185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25128492350228004,0.0,0.0,0.565936954869038,0.0,0.04787965041292146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05473812894477387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0368020599089559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741289187691105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05563690007832709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468664886866331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058771716182202303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2807114943312027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05871519173047267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051605432889028836,0.02922897638011599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0576165274560858,0.04320851612845314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04030656688408153,0.0,0.0,0.05473812894477387,0.04098055491499592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641667790157437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047340493420320526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09166309263197983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04531289611384516,0.0,0.04320851612845314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889241898180172,0.0,0.06260479005396076,0.0,0.0,0.037880730676140645,0.0
Intelligent resource allocation in wireless networks: Predictive models for efficient access point management,"With the significant increase in mobile users connected to the wireless network, coupled with the escalating energy consumption and the risk of network saturation, the search for resource management has become paramount. Managing several access points throughout a whole region is hugely relevant in this context. Moreover, a wireless network must keep its Service Level Agreement, regardless of the number of connected users. With that in mind, in this work, we propose four prediction models that allow one to predict the number of connected users on a wireless network. Once the number of users has been predicted, the network resources can be properly allocated, minimizing the number of active access points. We investigate the use of Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithms to hyper-parameterize a Multilayer Perceptron neural network and a Decision Tree. We evaluate our proposal using a campus-based wireless network dataset with more than 20,000 connected users. As a result, our model can considerably improve network performance by intelligently allocating the number of access points, thereby addressing concerns related to energy consumption and network saturation. The results have shown an average accuracy of 95.18%, managing to save network resources effectively.",Networking,intellig resourc alloc wireless network predict model effici access point manag,signific increas mobil user connect wireless network coupl escal energi consumpt risk network satur search resourc manag becom paramount manag sever access point throughout whole region huge relev context moreov wireless network must keep servic level agreement regardless number connect user mind work propos four predict model allow one predict number connect user wireless network number user predict network resourc properli alloc minim number activ access point investig use particl swarm optim genet algorithm hyperparameter multilay perceptron neural network decis tree evalu propos use campusbas wireless network dataset 20000 connect user result model consider improv network perform intellig alloc number access point therebi address concern relat energi consumpt network satur result shown averag accuraci 9518 manag save network resourc effect,intellig resourc alloc wireless network predict model effici access point manag signific increas mobil user connect wireless network coupl escal energi consumpt risk network satur search resourc manag becom paramount manag sever access point throughout whole region huge relev context moreov wireless network must keep servic level agreement regardless number connect user mind work propos four predict model allow one predict number connect user wireless network number user predict network resourc properli alloc minim number activ access point investig use particl swarm optim genet algorithm hyperparameter multilay perceptron neural network decis tree evalu propos use campusbas wireless network dataset 20000 connect user result model consider improv network perform intellig alloc number access point therebi address concern relat energi consumpt network satur result shown averag accuraci 9518 manag save network resourc effect,0.0,0.0,0.23036684287059384,0.0,0.05759171071764846,0.0,0.0,0.05759171071764846,0.0,0.0,0.05449139255907003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04831858661672595,0.2233017952779621,0.06614946268745359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05759171071764846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06407337251416738,0.0,0.0,0.23901099012658852,0.0,0.06614946268745359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06728704407840218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062216246570769886,0.0,0.0,0.062216246570769886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03963800213706575,0.0471559855000255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11518342143529692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04571629635789142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03988452914635147,0.0,0.0,0.04571629635789142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958449424178657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05566692099122536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0562854544143268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20177929214691978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06508086922736074,0.07629105770271818,0.0,0.0,0.11605497600455414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06614946268745359,0.0,0.06312036237861966,0.0,0.0,0.4108019792733225,0.06508086922736074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2846324241662443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04999856138221907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04956331966794377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044067769225775995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26459785074981435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2562934900566695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06987660062294938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05759171071764846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094089531905724,0.0,0.06950355176966867,0.0,0.06407337251416738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06053627180527675,0.0,0.0613562519219591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0523522382976431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05387474367772844,0.27833460495612683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37216965879660346,0.0,0.0,0.045038274542742805,0.0
Protecting unauthenticated messages in LTE/5G mobile networks: A two-level Hierarchical Identity-Based Signature (HIBS) solution,"As an essential public infrastructure, the security and reliability of mobile networks have a profound impact on people’s production and life. Although the security of LTE/5G networks has been improved a lot with the evolution of standards, there are still some unprotected messages being transmitted between the cellular network and device due to the symmetric key-based security architecture and the trade-off between security and other criteria like network availability. By exploiting these messages, various security attacks have been proposed and demonstrated against commercial mobile networks and devices in existing literature, such as user location tracking, bidding-down, and DoS attacks. To address this security issue, in this paper, we aim to protect these unauthenticated messages in mobile networks using digital signatures. Based on the idea of Hierarchical Identity-Based Signature (HIBS) in existing work, we analyse and design a two-level HIBS solution in detail in terms of different aspects such as keys generation and provisioning procedures, replay mitigation, and cell selection. Unlike previous work, our proposed solution also supports the protection of individual vulnerable RRC and NAS layer signalling in addition to authenticating the base station. We evaluated the efficiency and feasibility of several existing HIBS schemes and implemented the most efficient one in the 5G standalone network setup using open-source software. The implementation results further proved the feasibility of the solution in practice.",Networking,protect unauthent messag lte5g mobil network twolevel hierarch identitybas signatur hib solut,essenti

NeSt: A QoS differentiating end-to-end networked storage simulator,"The emerging high-speed storage technologies increasingly use Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) protocol to meet their high throughput and low latency needs. In a datacenter environment, applications accessing multiple such devices over the fabric (i.e. the network) tend to have Quality of Service (QoS) requirements pertaining to offered throughput and experienced latency. In this paper we describe a networked storage system simulator called NeSt that supports end-to-end (E2E) QoS differentiation across multiple classes of service. This is done by conveying the class designation end to end and using it to consistently but independently apply the differentiation in each segment of the path. We demonstrate the ability of NeSt to provide end-to-end QoS differentiation under a variety of situations. To the best of our knowledge, NeSt is the first simulator of networked storage (consisting of multiple NVMe SSDs) that supports E2E QoS differentiation.",Networking,nest qo differenti endtoend network storag simul,emerg highspe storag technolog increasingli use nonvolatil memori express nvme protocol meet high throughput low latenc need datacent environ applic access multipl devic fabric ie network tend qualiti servic qo requir pertain offer throughput experienc latenc paper describ network storag system simul call nest support endtoend e2e qo differenti across multipl class servic done convey class design end end use consist independ appli differenti segment path demonstr abil nest provid endtoend qo differenti varieti situat best knowledg nest first simul network storag consist multipl nvme ssd support e2e qo differenti,nest qo differenti endtoend network storag simul emerg highspe storag technolog increasingli use nonvolatil memori express nvme protocol meet high throughput low latenc need datacent environ applic access multipl devic fabric ie network tend qualiti servic qo requir pertain offer throughput experienc latenc paper describ network storag system simul call nest support endtoend e2e qo differenti across multipl class servic done convey class design end end use consist independ appli differenti segment path demonstr abil nest provid endtoend qo differenti varieti situat best knowledg nest first simul network storag consist multipl nvme ssd support e2e qo differenti,0.10737832620290753,0.0,0.09797316217750109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09368221853970857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659399391800582,0.0678502755645928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11071347726975979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116535333337894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22142695453951958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992914498485807,0.0,0.0,0.11875749446240282,0.07143489107460112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10298235460094061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09269900084478042,0.0,0.0,0.233070666675788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09797316217750109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09797316217750109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09575100105299227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10584027352890414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211576113205946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116535333337894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31752082058671244,0.0,0.0,0.0783648807480181,0.2541247591278802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10737832620290753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050413518400218335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116535333337894,0.06914481269995634,0.0,0.08659399391800582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07289788625480684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211576113205946,0.0,0.20596470920188123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2486621203107486,0.0,0.11875749446240282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4846304452823784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657747468738324,0.0,0.049483662400270134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06743089176159558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2948178761974152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09164997764152034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Performance enhancement of NOMA multi-user networks with aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and aerial relay,"In this article, we propose a combination of multiple aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARISs) with an aerial relay (AR) for improving the performance of multiple users adopting the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. In particular, two groups of ARIS are utilized, one for aiding ground-to-air (G2A) communication and another one for aiding air-to-ground (A2G) communication. Mathematical formulas of outage probability (OP), throughput, and achievable capacity (AC) of every user in the proposed ARISs-AR-NOMA network are derived over the Nakagami-
 channel. The propagation environment recommended for the fifth generation and beyond (5G/B5G) is applied to enhance the practical behavior of the proposed network. To confirm the performance enhancement, we compare the OP, throughput, and AC of the proposed system with the conventional AR-NOMA network (i.e., without ARISs). Numerical illustrations demonstrate the great benefits of the proposed ARISs-AR-NOMA network, its transmit power is dramatically lower than that of the conventional network. Moreover, the throughput and AC of the proposed network are considerably higher than the conventional network’s.

An intrusion detection method combining variational auto-encoder and generative adversarial networks,"Deep learning is a crucial research area in network security, particularly when it comes to detecting network attacks. While some deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in distinguishing between normal and abnormal traffic, identifying different types of imbalanced anomalous traffic data is still a challenging task at present. To enhance the detection performance of unbalanced anomalous flows, we propose a new intrusion detection architecture based on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) in this research. Firstly, we present the VAE-WGAN model, which combines the advantages of VAE and GAN and enables us to generate data with predefined labels to balance the original training dataset. In the intrusion detection phase, we use a hybrid neural network model based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). Stacked LSTM and MSCNN networks can extract network characteristics at different depths and scales, and subsequent feature fusion is used to increase network attack detection rates. Finally, the results from the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets indicate that the proposed network intrusion detection model improves the accuracy of network attack detection. The model outperforms other existing intrusion detection approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, obtaining 83.45% accuracy and 83.69% f1-score on the NSL-KDD dataset. Moreover, it attains an accuracy and f1-score exceeding 98.9% on the AWID dataset.",Networking,intrus detect method combin variat autoencod gener adversari network,deep learn crucial research area

"NDN multicast over wireless networks: A survey on fundamentals, challenges, and open issues","Wireless devices have shown remarkable growth in data demand in the last decade due to the proliferation of smart devices and the emergence of bandwidth-hungry applications. This increasing data traffic demand is overcrowding the radio frequency spectrum, leading wireless multicast schemes to become a popular research topic again, as they provide efficient data dissemination. NDN supports multicast communication by design. It is a networked system formed by named entities that adopt a communication model focusing on the content rather than its location. The architecture follows a receiver-driven communication model through which content consumers retrieve data through semantically meaningful names instead of specific destinations. Its properties are essential for multicast communication on ad hoc networks, as its features provide enhanced support for dynamic topologies, decentralized control, and the self-organization of participant nodes that communicate without needing a pre-existing network infrastructure. However, despite the wireless medium being broadcast by nature, NDN multicast is still challenging in wireless scenarios, especially in ad hoc environments, due to the node’s high mobility, link instability, constant handovers, and data transmission over a shared medium. Hence, this survey discusses the benefits of NDN for mobile scenarios through an in-depth analysis of NDN multicast features, focusing on fundamentals, challenges, and open issues when applied to wireless networking.",Networking,ndn multicast wireless network survey fundament challeng open issu,wireless devic shown remark growth data demand last decad due prolifer smart devic emerg

DDQN-SFCAG: A service function chain recovery method against network attacks in 6G networks,"Service Function Chain (SFC) as an effective solution can satisfy the diverse service requirements of six application scenarios in Network Function Virtualization (NFV)-enabled 6G networks. Resilience as a new key capability indicator in 6G networks puts forward higher requirements for the Quality of Service (QoS) of SFCs. In this article, we study the resilience recovery method in network attack scenarios. We make full use of the monitoring and early warning capability of the monitoring function and propose a proactive recovery method called Double Deep Q-Network based on SFC Attack Graph (DDQN-SFCAG). We fully consider the characteristics of network attacks to generate SFC attack graphs and determine the recovery strategy of SFC according to the service security requirements to provide guidance for recovery. Among them, we design three recovery modes for the recovered Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to determine the optimal recovery strategy and avoid resource waste. We formalize the SFC recovery problem, which aims to minimize the recovery cost while meeting the recovery strategy. In order to shorten the interruption time, we use DDQN to quickly solve the recovery solution to ensure optimal recovery performance. Our extensive evaluation shows DDQN-SFCAG has excellent recovery performance in network attack scenarios and can reduce the recovery cost by at least 31% compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",Networking,ddqnsfcag servic function chain recoveri method network attack 6g network,servic function chain sfc effect solut satisfi divers servic requir six applic scenario network function

Multi-view multi-label network traffic classification based on MLP-Mixer neural network ,"Network traffic classification is the basis of many network security applications and has received significant attention in the field of cyberspace security. Existing research on deep traffic analysis typically involves converting traffic data into images to extract spatial traffic features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, this approach ignores the semantic differences and details in the various packet structures. In this paper, we propose an MLP-Mixer based multi-view multi-label neural network for network traffic classification. Compared with the existing CNN-based methods, our method adopts the MLP-Mixer structure, which is more in line with the structure of the packet than the conventional convolution operation. In our method, one packet is divided into the packet header and the packet payload, together with the flow statistics of the packet as input from different views.

Themis: A passive-active hybrid framework with in-network intelligence for lightweight failure localization,"The fast and efficient failure detection and localization is essential for stable network transmission. Unfortunately, existing schemes suffer from a few drawbacks such as significant resource consumption , lack of support for fast online failure localization, and limited applicable topologies. In this paper, we design Themis, a lightweight learning-based failure localization scheme for general networks. In the data plane, Themis achieves line-speed high performance failure detection using in-network classifiers and fine-grained traffic features. To reduce communication overhead, only coarse-grained traffic features are reported to the control plane for localization when a failure occurs. In the control plane, we propose a two-stage passive-active hybrid failure localization approach to accurately locate the failure without incurring excessive probing traffic. First, passive detection is conducted through the lightweight model XGBoost to infer a Potential Failure Link Set (PFLS). Then, active detection is done by only sending out probing packets to locations in the PFLS for precise failure localization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Themis achieves ms-level failure localization with at least 95.63% accuracy, while saving 87.41% of bandwidth and 41.88% of hardw",Networking,themi passiveact hybrid framework innetwork intellig lightweight failur local,fast effici failur detect local essenti stabl network transmiss unfortun exist scheme suffer drawback signific resourc consumpt lack support fast onlin failur local limit applic topolog paper design themi lightweight learningbas failur local scheme gener network data plane themi achiev linespe high perform failur detect use innetwork classifi finegrain traffic featur reduc commun overhead coarsegrain traffic featur report control plane local failur occur control plane propos twostag passiveact hybrid failur local approach accur locat failur without incur excess probe traffic first passiv detect conduct lightweight model xgboost infer potenti failur link set pfl activ detect done send probe packet locat pfl precis failur local comprehens experi demonstr themi achiev mslevel failur local least 9563 accuraci save 8741 bandwidth 4188 hardw,themi passiveact hybrid framework innetwork intellig lightweight failur local fast effici failur detect local essenti stabl network transmiss unfortun exist scheme suffer drawback signific resourc consumpt lack support fast onlin failur local limit applic topolog paper design themi lightweight learningbas failur local scheme gener network data plane themi achiev linespe high perform failur detect use innetwork classifi finegrain traffic featur reduc commun overhead coarsegrain traffic featur report control plane local failur occur control plane propos twostag passiveact hybrid failur local approach accur locat failur without incur excess probe traffic first passiv detect conduct lightweight model xgboost infer potenti failur link set pfl activ detect done send probe packet locat pfl precis failur local comprehens experi demonstr themi achiev mslevel failur local least 9563 accuraci save 8741 bandwidth 4188 hardw,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05215937279340425,0.08977651940617681,0.0,0.05215937279340425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03612242106564892,0.03991107703832434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06322462486668205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044503571587707604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05041613885160277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05041613885160277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08825587160552129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033629504844942995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0478768643780132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038030814063813055,0.0,0.1708319892906022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04270799732265055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04340218426958324,0.0,0.0456866152695097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.709526503247698,0.1264492497333641,0.0,0.1082331396340437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05215937279340425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0478768643780132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03567895409650932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050976329111602145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04340218426958324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06450240938615436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048353430642220814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5271315219151452,0.12188038773351119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035036030258061235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676460152596212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709751669100489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026839365410091756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03991107703832434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04741411359220339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031642745249372745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048353430642220814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060940193866755595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04741411359220339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11605930372451963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04935149213494869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04741411359220339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04412793580276064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06204158118487995,0.0,0.0,0.1667064709829562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05894211645129101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024396504328656924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05716653440461685,0.0,0.0
6TiSCH IIoT network: A review,"Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLN) constitute an interconnected network of numerous resource-constrained nodes, forming a wireless mesh network. The Time slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode, introduced as a revision of the Medium Access Control (MAC) section within the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, stands as an emerging standard for industrial automation and process control. In 2013, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) established the IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH) working group (WG), defining the IPv6 deterministic wireless network—6TiSCH. This development is pivotal for advancing the broader adoption of IPv6 in industrial standards and facilitating the convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT). As of July 2023, the primary documents encompassing architecture, configuration and parameters, and Minimum Scheduling Function for the 6TiSCH protocol stack have been completed, and the status of the WG has transitioned from active to concluded. Over the past decade, the academic community has extensively researched protocol stacks related to 6TiSCH.

Achieving scalable capacity in wireless mesh networks,"Wireless mesh networks are critical in enabling key networking scenarios in beyond-5G (B5G) and 6G networks, including integrated access and backhaul (IAB), multi-hop sidelinks, and V2X. However, it still poses a challenge to deliver scalable per-node throughput via mesh networking. As shown in Gupta and Kumar’s seminal research (Gupta and Kumar, 2000), multi-hop transmission results in a per-node throughput of  in a wireless network with  nodes, significantly limiting the potential of large-scale deployment of wireless mesh networks. Follow-up research has achieved per-node throughput in a dense network, but how to achieve scalability remains an unresolved issue for an extended wireless network where the network size increases with a constant node density. This issue prevents a wireless mesh network from large-scale deployment. To this end, this paper aims to develop a theoretical approach to achieving scalable per-node throughput in wireless mesh networks. First, the key factors that limit the per-node throughput of wireless mesh networks are analyzed, through which two major ones are identified, i.e., link sharing and interference. Next, a multi-tier hierarchical architecture is proposed to overcome the link-sharing issue. The inter-tier interference under this architecture is then mitigated by utilizing orthogonal frequency allocation between adjacent tiers, while the intra-tier interference is reduced by considering two specific transmission schemes, one is MIMO spatial multiplexing with time-division, the other is MIMO beamforming. Theoretical analysis shows that the multi-tier mesh networking architecture can achieve a per-node throughput of  in both schemes, as long as certain conditions on network parameters including bandwidth, the number of antennas, and the number of nodes of each tier are satisfied. A case study on a realistic deployment of 10,000 nodes is then carried out, which demonstrates that a scalable throughput of  is achievable with a reasonable assumption on bandwidth and the number of antennas.",Networking,achiev scalabl capac wireless mesh network,wireless mesh network critic enabl key network scenario beyond5g b5g 6g network includ integr access backhaul iab multihop sidelink v2x

Efficient load distribution in heterogeneous vehicular networks using hierarchical controllers,"Vehicle movement poses significant challenges in vehicular networks, often resulting in uneven traffic distribution. Fog computing (FC) addresses this by operating at the network edge, handling specific tasks locally instead of relying solely on cloud computing (CC) facilities. There are instances where FC may need additional resources and must delegate tasks to CC, leading to increased delay and response time. This work conducts a thorough examination of previous load balancing (LB) strategies, with a specific focus on software-defined networking (SDN) and machine learning (ML) based LB within the internet of vehicles (IoV). The insights derived from this research expedite the development of SDN controller-based LB solutions in the IoV network. The authors proposes the integration of a local SDN controller (LSDNC) within the FC tier to enable localized LB, addressing delay concerns. However, the information will be available to the main SDN controller (MSDNC) too. The authors explore the concept mathematically and simulates the formulated model and subjecting it to a comprehensive performance analysis. The simulation results demonstrate a significant reduction in delay, with a 125 ms difference when 200 onboard units (OBUs) are used, compared to conventional software-defined vehicular networks (SDVN). This improvement continues to increase as the number of OBUs grows. Our model achieves the same maximum throughput as the previous model but delivers faster response times, as decisions are made locally without the need to wait for the main controller.",Networking,effici load distribut heterogen vehicular network use hierarch control,vehicl movement pose signific challeng vehicular network often result uneven traffic distribut fog comput

Neural quantile optimization for edge–cloud networking,"We seek the best traffic allocation scheme for the edge–cloud networking subject to SD-WAN architecture and burstable billing. First, we formulate a family of quantile-based integer programming problems for a fixed network topology with random parameters describing the traffic demands. Then, to overcome the difficulty caused by the discrete feature, we generalize the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization method to induce an unconstrained continuous optimization problem as a regularized continuation of the discrete problem. Finally, we introduce the Gumbel-softmax sampling neural network to solve optimization problems via unsupervised learning. The neural network structure reflects the edge–cloud networking topology and is trained to minimize the expectation of the cost function for unconstrained continuous optimization problems. The trained network works as an efficient traffic allocation scheme sampler, outperforming the random strategy in feasibility and cost value. Besides testing the quality of the output allocation scheme, we examine the generalization property of the network by increasing the time steps and the number of users. We also feed the solution to existing integer optimization solvers as initial conditions and verify the warm-starts can accelerate the short-time iteration process. The framework is general, and the decoupled feature of the random neural networks is adequate for practical implementations.",Networking,neural quantil optim edgecloud network,seek best traffic alloc scheme edgecloud network subject sdwan architectur burstabl bill first formul famili quantilebas integ program problem fix network topolog random paramet describ traffic demand overcom difficulti caus discret featur gener gumbelsoftmax reparameter method induc unconstrain continu optim problem regular continu discret problem final introduc gumbelsoftmax sampl neural network solv optim problem via unsupervis learn neural network structur reflect edgecloud network topolog train minim expect cost function unconstrain continu optim problem train network work effici traffic alloc scheme sampler outperform random strategi feasibl cost valu besid test qualiti output alloc scheme examin gener properti network increas time step number user also feed solut exist integ optim solver initi condit verifi warmstart acceler shorttim iter process framework gener decoupl featur random neural network adequ practic implement,neural quantil optim edgecloud network seek best traffic alloc scheme edgecloud network subject sdwan architectur burstabl bill first formul famili quantilebas integ program problem fix network topolog random paramet describ traffic demand overcom difficulti caus discret featur gener gumbelsoftmax reparameter method induc unconstrain continu optim problem regular continu discret problem final introduc gumbelsoftmax sampl neural network solv optim problem via unsupervis learn neural network structur reflect edgecloud network topolog train minim expect cost function unconstrain continu optim problem train network work effici traffic alloc scheme sampler outperform random strategi feasibl cost valu besid test qualiti output alloc scheme examin gener properti network increas time step number user also feed solut exist integ optim solver initi condit verifi warmstart acceler shorttim iter process framework gener decoupl featur random neural network adequ practic implement,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27133806185623927,0.0,0.0,0.04729052374298746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07260664736546531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07908094468335969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07455509463568821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2497182224770043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13834480859157483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865410300090805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482666322034894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482666322034894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05730009333140644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08323940749233476,0.0,0.05823146401938743,0.08482666322034894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14521329473093061,0.0,0.06301078626636807,0.0,0.06998073233428305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08323940749233476,0.06423501379729381,0.0,0.06553348109359529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14360828377775617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055974836599634016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055550700940647256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08037941197966118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06361415435928824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05035547920123653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04617764221557476,0.0,0.07908094468335969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40841422072915534,0.31632377873343875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06917240429578742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011264437243046,0.0,0.0,0.08482666322034894,0.0,0.07785671715243396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05513480144821717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2960259200306106,0.042683235761206126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06917240429578742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061852766364257655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176170776209987,0.0,0.0,0.2335701514573019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06621347950391855,0.08176170776209987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06917240429578742,0.07169509912301462,0.0,0.0,0.08323940749233476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06242395090361402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055550700940647256,0.0,0.0,0.16647881498466952,0.0,0.0,0.22366528390706464,0.13834480859157483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676418854244392,0.0,0.0,0.08037941197966118,0.0,0.0,0.07455509463568821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05472682433459638,0.0
PETIT: PUF-enabled trust evaluation framework for IoT networks,"Internet-of-Things (IoT) is characterized by the incorporation of resource constrained devices that are inter-networked in an ad-hoc manner. Given the diversity of the devices and the operating conditions, it is important to assess the trustworthiness of IoT nodes and factor it in the network management. Contemporary trust evaluation and management schemes found in the literature mostly consider observable network-level behavior parameters and initially assume that all nodes are equally trustworthy owing to the absence of historical data or background. Such an equal trust initialization approach raises concerns in terms of accuracy, fairness, and adaptability. This paper aims to mitigate these shortcomings by proposing a novel trust evaluation and aggregation framework. Our framework leverages hardware primitives such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to assign trust scores at the network bootstrapping phase. The paper explores the establishment of both direct and recommendation based indirect trust score evaluation and detection of irregularities to ensure the dynamic, safe, and reliable operation of the network. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that the trust value computed through this mechanism effectively and precisely mirrors the node’s credibility.",Networking,petit pufen trust evalu framework iot network,internetofth iot character incorpor resourc constrain devic internetwork adhoc manner given divers devic oper condit import assess trustworthi iot node factor network manag contemporari trust evalu manag scheme found literatur mostli consid observ networklevel behavior paramet initi assum node equal trustworthi owe absenc histor data background equal trust initi approach rais concern term accuraci fair adapt paper aim mitig shortcom propos novel trust evalu aggreg framework framework leverag hardwar primit physic unclon function puf assign trust score network bootstrap phase paper explor establish direct recommend base indirect trust score evalu detect irregular ensur dynam safe reliabl oper network simul outcom demonstr trust valu comput mechan effect precis mirror node credibl,petit pufen trust evalu framework iot network internetofth iot character incorpor resourc constrain devic internetwork adhoc manner given divers devic oper condit import assess trustworthi iot node factor network manag contemporari trust evalu manag scheme found literatur mostli consid observ networklevel behavior paramet initi assum node equal trustworthi owe absenc histor data background equal trust initi approach rais concern term accuraci fair adapt paper aim mitig shortcom propos novel trust evalu aggreg framework framework leverag hardwar primit physic unclon function puf assign trust score network bootstrap phase paper explor establish direct recommend base indirect trust score evalu detect irregular ensur dynam safe reliabl oper network simul outcom demonstr trust valu comput mechan effect precis mirror node credibl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07189939232194797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840033664583385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09783613370877514,0.0,0.0,0.06354858211226391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05501565744158721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.073660761862037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043154839058515346,0.0,0.08891372326379784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056646430920187146,0.0,0.07999131281882056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599614356357371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04635678753301966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599614356357371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05887108855676759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1511509591223822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07189939232194797,0.0,0.0,0.07999131281882056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124910496533454,0.0,0.0,0.049485390015298884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07189939232194797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.073660761862037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22829493247438565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06949642130488909,0.0,0.0,0.07880154351402475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19798843069072114,0.0,0.06733021090525347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05982799461160038,0.0,0.0,0.0825831723070143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651663446140286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2724853228888558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715235372370882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07026861884334804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12595396375394138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18649409031172318,0.0,0.0,0.2520100993750155,0.0755754795611911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840033664583385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10925234333457325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07399376027528957,0.07999131281882056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08552158024510886,0.0929257769033158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043618127155006764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715235372370882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06875040505657767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0653582620378887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07999131281882056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06082841105485132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6667099195440698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825831723070143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Novel modeling and optimization for joint Cybersecurity-vs-QoS Intrusion Detection Mechanisms in 5G networks,"The rapid emergence of 5G technology brings new cybersecurity challenges that hold significant implications for our economy, society, and environment. Among these challenges, ensuring the effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Mechanisms (IDMs) in monitoring networks and detecting 5G-related cyberattacks is of utmost importance. However, optimizing cybersecurity levels and selecting appropriate IDMs remain as critical and ongoing challenges. This work considers multiple pre-deployed distributed Security Agents (SAs) across the network, each capable of running various IDMs, where they differ by their effectiveness in detecting the attacks (referred to as security term) and the consumption of resources (referred to as Quality of Service (QoS) costs). We formulate a joint security and QoS utility function leveraging the Cobb–Douglas production utility function. There are several parameters that impact the joint objective problem, including the set of elasticity parameters, that reflect the importance of the two objectives. We derive an optimal set of elasticity parameters in closed form to identify the balancing point where both objectives have equal utility values. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that increasing the detection level of SAs enhances the security utility while simultaneously diminishing the QoS utility, as more computational, bandwidth, and monetary resources are utilized for IDM processing. After optimization, our mechanism can strike an effective balance between cybersecurity and QoS overhead while demonstrating the importance of different parameters in the joint problem.",Networking,novel model optim joint cybersecurityvsqo intrus detect mechan 5g network,rapid emerg 5g technolog bring new cybersecur challeng hold signific implic economi societi environ among

Surveying cybersecurity vulnerabilities and countermeasures for enhancing UAV security,"Drones and other forms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usages are increasing with time from military operations like surveillance, reconnaissance to commercial operations such as transportation, agriculture. The Drone market will be grown to around 43 billion USD by the 2025. With the increase in the usages, there is increase in cyber-attacks. So, Drone security and privacy are of major concern as they are used to perform the critical operations. The rapid adoption of UAVs in various sectors has prompted the need for robust and comprehensive cyber security measures. By implementing robust countermeasures, such as authentication, encryption etc. the risks posed by cyber threats can be significantly mitigated. The study investigates cyber security vulnerabilities and countermeasures in UAV systems within the scope of Authentication techniques, Physical Layer Security, Covert Communication.

"A survey on deep learning for cybersecurity: Progress, challenges, and opportunities","As the number of Internet-connected systems rises, cyber analysts find it increasingly difficult to effectively monitor the produced volume of data, its velocity and diversity. Signature-based cybersecurity strategies are unlikely to achieve the required performance for detecting new attack vectors. Moreover, technological advances enable attackers to develop sophisticated attack strategies that can avoid detection by current security systems. As the cyber-threat landscape worsens, we need advanced tools and technologies to detect, investigate, and make quick decisions regarding emerging attacks and threats. Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to analyze and automatically classify vast amounts of Internet traffic. AI-based solutions that automate the detection of attacks and tackle complex cybersecurity problems are gaining increasing attention. This paper comprehensively presents the promising applications of deep learning, a subfield of AI based on multiple layers of artificial neural networks, in a wide variety of security tasks. Before critically and comparatively surveying state-of-the-art solutions from the literature, we discuss the key characteristics of representative deep learning architectures employed in cybersecurity applications, we introduce the emerging trends in deep learning, and we provide an overview of necessary resources like a generic framework and suitable datasets. We identify the limitations of the reviewed works, and we bring forth a vision of the current challenges of the area, providing valuable insights and good practices for researchers and developers working on related problems. Finally, we uncover current pain points and outline directions for future research to address them.",Networking,survey deep learn cybersecur progress challeng opportun,number internetconnect system

A differential game view of antagonistic dynamics for cybersecurity,"A fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the antagonism between the attacker and the defender can strengthen forward-looking and strategic planning for the cybersecurity. Most of the existing works have one or more of the following limitations: static modeling, non co-evolved strategy and synchronized setting, not accounting for the dynamic nature of the cyber arms race between the defensive and offensive sides. In this paper, we apply differential game theory to analyze the antagonistic dynamics between the attacker and the defender and study two complementary game theoretic formulations, namely the black-box game the and the white-box game: The black-box game can cogently model the opaque-information confrontation and the white-box one is capable to depict the partially transparent-information confrontation. To gain insight into the evolution rule of the antagonistic dynamics between the defensive and the offensive sides, we establish the existence of the Nash equilibrium and the corresponding conditions in the black-box game. Moreover, an iteration algorithm is designed to find the numerical solutions of the Nash equilibrium in the general case and further its analytical solutions in a special case for the white-box game. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed games.",Networking,differenti game view antagonist dynam cybersecur,fundament understand dynam antagon attack defend strengthen forwardlook strateg plan cybersecur exist work one follow limit static model non coevolv strategi synchron set account dynam natur cyber arm race defens offens side paper appli differenti game theori analyz antagonist dynam attack defend studi two complementari game theoret formul name blackbox game whitebox game blackbox game cogent model opaqueinform confront whitebox one capabl depict partial transparentinform confront gain insight evolut rule antagonist dynam defens offens side establish exist nash equilibrium correspond condit blackbox game moreov iter algorithm design find numer solut nash equilibrium gener case analyt solut special case whitebox game extens numer simul carri evalu perform propos game,differenti game view antagonist dynam cybersecur fundament understand dynam antagon attack defend strengthen forwardlook strateg plan cybersecur exist work one follow limit static model non coevolv strategi synchron set account dynam natur cyber arm race defens offens side paper appli differenti game theori analyz antagonist dynam attack defend studi two complementari game theoret formul name blackbox game whitebox game blackbox game cogent model opaqueinform confront whitebox one capabl depict partial transparentinform confront gain insight evolut rule antagonist dynam defens offens side establish exist nash equilibrium correspond condit blackbox game moreov iter algorithm design find numer solut nash equilibrium gener case analyt solut special case whitebox game extens numer simul carri evalu perform propos game,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05005265735177665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052729486478825575,0.052729486478825575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11532942154552712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05586729597323124,0.0,0.0,0.06538564331605236,0.12224015131486936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07536497102623019,0.13077128663210472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17286477866377647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043498687987543305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370825468708213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06112007565743468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047356975383914146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09928465209041452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05830544229358997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07096159913081675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06970186003545738,0.8078525462313675,0.040808689747261574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06970186003545738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055305437035980086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08014665928319759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06852345281045802,0.0,0.0,0.06355822197779343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419231982616335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10358584702805432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0306981906776515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0456492854563632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06270881418900343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03619217564899478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056446994652698604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05047242238353949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11289398930539721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05896947818861479,0.0,0.0,0.03913676667680038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06970186003545738,0.07377623249466146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056446994652698604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05766471077276356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04665462053525398,0.0
"Cybersecurity in industrial control systems: Issues, technologies, and challenges","Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) play an important role in today’s industry by providing process automation, distributed control, and process monitoring. ICS was designed to be used in an isolated area or connected to other systems via specialised communication mechanisms or protocols. This setup allows manufacturers to manage their production processes with great flexibility and safety. However, this design does not meet today’s business requirements to work with state-of-the-art technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and big data analytics. In order to fulfil industry requirements, many ICSs have been connected to enterprise networks that allow business users to access real-time data generated by power plants. At the same time, this new design opens up several cybersecurity challenges for ICSs.
We review possible cyber attacks on ICSs, identify typical threats and vulnerabilities, and we discuss unresolved security issues with existing ICS cybersecurity solutions. Then, we discuss how to secure ICSs (e.g., using risk assessment methodologies) and other protection measures. We also identify open security research challenges for ICSs, and we present a classification of existing security solutions along with their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide future research directions in ICS security.",Networking,cybersecur industri control system issu technolog challeng,industri control system icss play import role today industri

A systematic evaluation of cybersecurity metrics for dynamic networks,"It is difficult to assess the security of modern networks because they are usually dynamic with configuration changes (such as changes in topology, firewall rules, etc). Graphical security models (e.g., Attack Graphs and Attack Trees) are widely used to systematically analyse the security posture of network systems using security metrics. However, there are problems using them to assess the security of dynamic networks. First, most models are unable to capture dynamic changes occurring in the networks over time. Second, the existing security metrics are not designed for the analysis of dynamic networks and hence their effectiveness to the dynamic changes in the network still remains unclear.
In this paper, we systematically categorise network changes into two categories (i.e., changes in hosts and changes in edges). We conduct a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of security metrics using a Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model, which can capture and analyse the changes in the security of network systems. Further, we investigate the varying effects of security metrics when changes are observed in the dynamic networks.
Our simulation results show that different security metrics (except the shortest attack path) have varying security posture changes with respect to changes in the network (when we introduce time to them). However, none of the security metrics consistently changes for all the network changes that we observe in our scenarios. Hence, the results provide some insights into what security metrics can change (accordingly) when a particular network change is observed. It also provides a foundation for further research in this area.",Networking,systemat evalu cybersecur metric dynam network,difficult assess secur modern network usual dynam configur chang chang

CGAN-based cyber deception framework against reconnaissance attacks in ICS,"In recent years, Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have faced increasing vulnerability to cyber attacks due to their integration with the Internet. Despite efforts to enhance cybersecurity, reconnaissance attacks remain a significant threat, prompting the need for innovative defensive strategies. This paper introduces a novel approach to strengthen the defensive capabilities of ICS networks against reconnaissance attacks using machine learning-driven cyber deception techniques. Leveraging Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs), the proposed framework dynamically generates defensive network topologies to network shuffling and implement deception strategies, prioritizing system availability. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior efficacy of the proposed framework in enhancing cybersecurity while minimizing computational overhead. By effectively mitigating reconnaissance attacks, this solution reinforces the resilience of ICS networks, safeguarding critical industrial infrastructure from evolving cyber threats. These findings underscore the significance of adopting machine learning-based cyber deception as a pragmatic security measure for protecting ICS networks in real-world industrial contexts.",Networking,cganbas cyber decept framework reconnaiss attack ic,recent year industri control system icss face increas vulner cyber attack due integr internet despit effort enhanc cybersecur reconnaiss attack remain signific threat prompt need innov defens strategi paper introduc novel approach strengthen defens capabl ic network reconnaiss attack use machin learningdriven cyber decept techniqu leverag condit gener adversari network cgan propos framework dynam gener defens network topolog network shuffl implement decept strategi priorit system avail extens simul demonstr superior efficaci propos framework enhanc cybersecur minim comput overhead effect mitig reconnaiss attack solut reinforc resili ic network safeguard critic industri infrastructur evolv cyber threat find underscor signific adopt machin learningbas cyber decept pragmat secur measur protect ic network realworld industri context,cganbas cyber decept framework reconnaiss attack ic recent year industri control system icss face increas vulner cyber attack due integr internet despit effort enhanc cybersecur reconnaiss attack remain signific threat prompt need innov defens strategi paper introduc novel approach strengthen defens capabl ic network reconnaiss attack use machin learningdriven cyber decept techniqu leverag condit gener adversari network cgan propos framework dynam gener defens network topolog network shuffl implement decept strategi priorit system avail extens simul demonstr superior efficaci propos framework enhanc cybersecur minim comput overhead effect mitig reconnaiss attack solut reinforc resili ic network safeguard critic industri infrastructur evolv cyber threat find underscor signific adopt machin learningbas cyber decept pragmat secur measur protect ic network realworld industri context,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07919575475044624,0.0,0.0,0.09711173895075823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056094355355140665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.354295225566112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07418912005088964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06865036159325942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057757103584759655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08565042950082392,0.0,0.0,0.0620210802537845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07510503634363712,0.0,0.0,0.4630466198771513,0.16069322770895011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31862727617137176,0.0,0.0,0.06729013704970423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06663974851232747,0.08284216490644762,0.0,0.0,0.050455655380528014,0.0,0.08886115929824646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12728745378740566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08719841106862747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0760599393246731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07164638321188406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20187041114911267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10029235381783991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058637092194146236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058192783943338516,0.196178811048928,0.0,0.08284216490644762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0620210802537845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08420238945000283,0.0,0.06663974851232747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886115929824646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466182628830061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246235798764912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08284216490644762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058637092194146236,0.28522605000276685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07705729611868686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037722281946299674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474778260718963,0.08894670493237213,0.08565042950082392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886115929824646,0.0,0.06795994301232117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886115929824646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10275043892537086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06539293701630934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13327949702465494,0.0,0.0620210802537845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06936270185006436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14492471597529824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405302085761242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0620210802537845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18131412840076105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08719841106862747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034288881302822524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08420238945000283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07418912005088964
A generic learning simulation framework to assess security strategies in cyber-physical production systems,"Connected systems through computerized networks are at the heart of the Industry of the future. As they merge physical entities with cyber spaces, they fall under the paradigm of cyber-physical production systems. Cybersecurity is a key challenge for such systems, as they are subject to daily attempts of intruders to gain unauthorized access to their internal resources or to compromise their integrity. The fast increase of new attack strategies requires the rapid design and assessment of new defense strategies. It entails a complex, error-prone and time-consuming process, including the clear specification of the attack and defense strategies involved, and the design and implementation of the simulation model allowing to evaluate the performances of the defense strategy. This work intends to make such a process transparent to cybersecurity managers by limiting their workload to the sole specification of the characteristics of the system and the logic of the attack and the defense. It provides a generic hybrid simulation framework for flexible evaluation of cybersecurity policies, which is demonstrated on a SYN flooding application. Therefore, the contribution is twofold: (1) The proposed framework offers a high-level environment allowing various experts to collaborate by graphically modeling a given attack strategy and the envisioned defense strategy, without engaging in heavy implementation efforts. Then the framework's executable infrastructure, which combines simulation with machine learning to understanding the interactions between the attackers & the defender, will allow them assessing the performances of these strategies. The proposed framework differs from state-of-the-art cybersecurity simulation environments in its uniqueness to combining the expressive power of a universal simulation modeling formalism with the user-friendliness of a visual simulation tool. Therefore, it offers at one side, a very high modeling flexibility for easy exploration of various cybersecurity strategies, and at the other side, integrated learning capabilities for allowing self-adaptive user-based cybersecurity strategy design. (2) The application demonstrating the framework focuses on the most encountered and still uncontrolled threats in cybersecurity, i.e. the SYN-Flooding based Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The application targeted is not meant to propose yet another SYN flood detection algorithm or to improve the state-of-the-art in that domain, but to prove the framework operationality. The experimental results obtained showcase the ability of the framework to support learning simulation-based SYN flood defense algorithm design and validation.",Networking,gener learn simul framework

SPEAR SIEM: A Security Information and Event Management system for the Smart Grid,"The technological leap of smart technologies has brought the conventional electrical grid in a new digital era called Smart Grid (SG), providing multiple benefits, such as two-way communication, pervasive control and self-healing. However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cybersecurity in mind. Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates severe cybersecurity challenges. The Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems constitute an emerging technology in the cybersecurity area, having the capability to detect, normalise and correlate a vast amount of security events. They can orchestrate the entire security of a smart ecosystem, such as SG. Nevertheless, the current SIEM systems do not take into account the unique SG peculiarities and characteristics like the legacy communication protocols. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) SIEM, which focuses on SG. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a SIEM system capable of detecting, normalising and correlating cyberattacks and anomalies against a plethora of SG application-layer protocols. It is noteworthy that the detection performance of the SPEAR SIEM is demonstrated with real data originating from four real SG use case (a) hydropower plant, (b) substation, (c) power plant and (d)

AAE-DSVDD: A one-class classification model for VPN traffic identification,"Virtual Private Network(VPN) can provide a concealed transmission channel for communication and protect the privacy of users. However, it also brings hidden dangers to cybersecurity with its wide application. Malicious behavior or harmful information can be transmitted secretly through VPN tunnels to avoid firewall censorship. Therefore, VPN traffic identification is an important part of ensure cybersecurity. Although many efforts have been made for VPN traffic identification, existing methods mainly focus on supervised learning models. In this paper, we propose an one-class classification model called AAE-DSVDD for VPN traffic identification. First, we introduce Adversarial AutoEncoder(AAE) for preliminary modeling of VPN traffic. AAE can match the aggregated posterior distribution of the hidden layer to an arbitrary prior distribution. It associates the samples with a normal distribution in the hidden space. Secondly, We implement representation learning for VPN traffic via Deep Support Vector Data Description(DSVDD). A standardized method is designed to match the output distribution of DSVDD with the aggregated posterior distribution of AAE. It alleviates the hypersphere collapse problem of DSVDD and improves identification performance. Finally, we verify the abilities of the AAE-DSVDD model on the public dataset ISCXVPN. Compared with other one-class models, AAE-DSVDD achieved the best identification ability for VPN traffic identification. It also improves the recognition ability when identifying strange classes that are not included in the training data.",Networking,aaedsvdd oneclass classif model vpn traffic identif,virtual privat

DoS/DDoS-MQTT-IoT: A dataset for evaluating intrusions in IoT networks using the MQTT protocol,"Adversaries may exploit a range of vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These vulnerabilities are typically exploited to carry out attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, either against the IoT devices themselves, or using the devices to perform the attacks. These attacks are often successful due to the nature of the protocols used in the IoT. One popular protocol used for machine-to-machine IoT communications is the Message Queueing Telemetry Protocol (MQTT). Countermeasures for attacks against MQTT include testing defenses with existing datasets. However, there is a lack of real-world test datasets in this area. For this reason, this paper introduces a DoS/DDoS-MQTT-IoT dataset—that contains various DoS/DDoS attack scenarios using MQTT traffic—to help develop and test countermeasures against such attacks. To this end, a physical IoT testbed was constructed and a large volume of IoT data was generated that included standard MQTT traffic as well as 10 DoS scenarios. The usability of the dataset has been evaluated via machine learning.",Networking,dosddosmqttiot dataset evalu intrus iot network use mqtt protocol,adversari may exploit rang vulner internet thing iot environ vulner typic exploit carri attack denialofservic do attack either iot devic use devic perform attack attack often success due natur protocol use iot one popular protocol use machinetomachin iot commun messag queue telemetri protocol mqtt countermeasur attack mqtt includ test defens exist dataset howev lack realworld test dataset area reason paper introduc dosddosmqttiot datasetthat contain variou dosddo attack scenario use mqtt trafficto help develop test countermeasur attack end physic iot testb construct larg volum iot data gener includ standard mqtt traffic well 10 do scenario usabl dataset evalu via machin learn,dosddosmqttiot dataset evalu intrus iot network use mqtt protocol adversari may exploit rang vulner internet thing iot environ vulner typic exploit carri attack denialofservic do attack either iot devic use devic perform attack attack often success due natur protocol use iot one popular protocol use machinetomachin iot commun messag queue telemetri protocol mqtt countermeasur attack mqtt includ test defens exist dataset howev lack realworld test dataset area reason paper introduc dosddosmqttiot datasetthat contain variou dosddo attack scenario use mqtt trafficto help develop test countermeasur attack end physic iot testb construct larg volum iot data gener includ standard mqtt traffic well 10 do scenario usabl dataset evalu via machin learn,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08616083031086433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05456956120030559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4400798461203744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712862423962795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055495622128272415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712862423962795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04193574193383062,0.28106064457785096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09423231070802872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03763811238249576,0.13673569615436004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059125046318455325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07736538940231123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06504234918057636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10326122540553338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05412220035013397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04449138987799272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06286854944576777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0464980808031412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248812460740384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07470721735144423,0.0,0.059125046318455325,0.08406344802133718,0.0,0.0,0.5751629446783811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08043402383115428,0.0,0.05970209309993108,0.0,0.0,0.04680200609672044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06504234918057636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06286854944576777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06929390900514686,0.0,0.0421770384645735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07350037997680552,0.056466874267588306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03346848865884026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049768815648562365,0.0,0.0,0.08406344802133718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30946155760924493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06836784807718002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0788406360574508,0.07736538940231123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13327147390855967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07350037997680552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712862423962795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.174056498544884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06929390900514686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07470721735144423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15211129547272892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056970868783411975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14941443470288845,0.0,0.0,0.05970209309993108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Towards a Cyber Resilience Quantification Framework (CRQF) for IT infrastructure,"Cyber resilience quantification is the process of evaluating and measuring an organisation’s ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from cyber-attacks. It involves estimating IT systems, networks, and response strategies to ensure robust defence and effective recovery mechanisms in the event of a cyber-attack. Quantifying cyber resilience can be difficult due to the constantly changing components of IT infrastructure. Traditional methods like vulnerability assessments and penetration testing may not be effective. Measuring cyber resilience is essential to evaluate and strengthen an organisation’s preparedness against evolving cyber-attacks. It helps identify weaknesses, allocate resources, and ensure the uninterrupted operation of critical systems and information. There are various methods for measuring cyber resilience, such as evaluating, teaming and testing, and creating simulated models. This article proposes a cyber resilience quantification framework for IT infrastructure that utilises a simulation approach. This approach enables organisations to simulate different attack scenarios, identify vulnerabilities, and improve their cyber resilience. The comparative analysis of cyber resilience factors highlights pre-configuration’s robust planning and adaptation (61.44%), buffering supported’s initial readiness (44.53%), and network topologies’ robust planning but weak recovery and adaptation (60.04% to 77.86%), underscoring the need for comprehensive enhancements across all phases. The utilisation of the proposed factors is crucial in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of IT infrastructure in the event of a cyber-attack.",Networking,toward cyber resili quantif framework crqf

FTG-Net-E: A hierarchical ensemble graph neural network for DDoS attack detection,"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are a major threat to computer networks. These attacks can be carried out by flooding a network with malicious traffic, overwhelming its resources, and/or making it unavailable to legitimate users. Existing machine learning methods for DDoS attack detection typically use statistical features of network traffic, such as packet sizes and inter-arrival times. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between different traffic flows. This paper proposes a new DDoS attack detection approach that uses Graph Neural Networks (GNN) ensemble learning. GNN ensemble learning is a type of machine learning that combines multiple GNN models to improve the detection accuracy. We evaluated our approach on the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CICIDS2018) and CICIDS2017 datasets, a benchmark dataset for DDoS attack detection. Our work provides two main contributions. First, we extend our DDoS attack detection approach using GNN ensemble learning. Second, we explore the evaluation and fine-tuning of hyperparameter metrics through ensemble learning, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to a single GNN model and achieving an average 3.2% higher F1-score. Additionally, our approach effectively reduces overfitting by incorporating regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping. Specifically, we use a hierarchical ensemble of GNN, where each GNN learns the relationships between traffic flows at a different granularity level. We then use bagging and boosting to combine the predictions of the individual GNN, further improving detection accuracy. Results show that our system can achieve 99.67% accuracy, with a F1-score of 99.29%, which is better than state-of-the-art methods, even using single traffic architecture.",Networking,ftgnete hierarch

"Distributed denial of service attack prediction: Challenges, open issues and opportunities","Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the biggest cyber threats. DDoS attacks have evolved in quantity and volume to evade detection and increase damage. Changes during the COVID-19 pandemic have left traditional perimeter-based security measures vulnerable to attackers that have diversified their activities by targeting health services, e-commerce, and educational services. DDoS attack prediction searches for signals of attack preparation to warn about the imminence of the attack. Prediction is necessary to handle high-volumetric DDoS attacks and to increase the time to defend against them. This survey article presents the classification of studies from the literature comprising the current state-of-the-art on DDoS attack prediction. It highlights the results of this extensive literature review categorizing the works by prediction time, architecture, employed methodology, and the type of data utilized to predict attacks. Further, this survey details each identified study and, finally, it emphasizes the research opportunities to evolve the DDoS attack prediction state-of-the-art.",Networking,distribut denial servic attack predict challeng open issu opportun,distribut denial servic ddo attack one biggest cyber threat ddo attack evolv quantiti volum evad detect increas damag chang covid19 pandem left tradit perimeterbas secur measur vulner attack diversifi activ target health servic ecommerc educ servic ddo attack predict search signal attack prepar warn immin attack predict necessari handl highvolumetr ddo attack increas time defend survey articl present classif studi literatur compris current stateoftheart ddo attack predict highlight result extens literatur review categor work predict time architectur employ methodolog type data util predict attack survey detail identifi studi final emphas research opportun evolv ddo attack predict stateoftheart,distribut denial servic attack predict challeng open issu opportun distribut denial servic ddo attack one biggest cyber threat ddo attack evolv quantiti volum evad detect increas damag chang covid19 pandem left tradit perimeterbas secur measur vulner attack diversifi activ target health servic ecommerc educ servic ddo attack predict search signal attack prepar warn immin attack predict necessari handl highvolumetr ddo attack increas time defend survey articl present classif studi literatur compris current stateoftheart ddo attack predict highlight result extens literatur review categor work predict time architectur employ methodolog type data util predict attack survey detail identifi studi final emphas research opportun evolv ddo attack predict stateoftheart,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0537615797110582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05577889698617638,0.0,0.052542195853572275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5716127772783848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03843357918345023,0.06281212588869961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06791546230315325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04983872843086799,0.06791546230315325,0.0,0.03466252005226271,0.0,0.0,0.5073629863806726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06175019923527659,0.04401988136352134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07493081727405458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05440692329702212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05807856126614935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12789469020198008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048407029985541576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06175019923527659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045483436841567484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085351877209856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050867447903978916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10508439170714455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05314059460809183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06281212588869961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0466734120187316,0.0,0.05577889698617638,0.0,0.1161571225322987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4186852546307154,0.035897160426613436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03407828759414972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03244061247794858,0.05140697664128185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047956203092486695,0.0,0.0,0.22604125222294197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06394734510099004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13033345791695192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07053652554262768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11015722922081816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06648376385782684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085351877209856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05981217923295934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06175019923527659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047956203092486695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06175019923527659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042043008563317365,0.0
Passive operating system fingerprinting revisited: Evaluation and current challenges,"Fingerprinting a host's operating system is a very common yet precarious task in network, asset, and vulnerability management. Estimating the operating system via network traffic analysis may leverage TCP/IP header parameters or complex analysis of hosts' behavior using machine learning. However, the existing approaches are becoming obsolete as network traffic evolves which makes the problem still open. This paper discusses various approaches to passive OS fingerprinting and their evolution in the past twenty years. We illustrate their usage, compare their results in an experiment, and list challenges faced by the current fingerprinting approaches. The hosts' differences in network stack settings were initially the most important information source for OS fingerprinting, which is now complemented by hosts' behavioral analysis and combined approaches backed by machine learning. The most impactful reasons for this evolution were the Internet-wide network traffic encryption and the general adoption of privacy-preserving concepts in application protocols. Other changes, such as the increasing proliferation of web applications on handheld devices, raised the need to identify these devices in the networks, for which we may use the techniques of OS fingerprinting.",Networking,passiv oper system fingerprint revisit evalu current challeng,fingerprint host oper system common yet precari task network asset vulner manag estim oper system via network traffic analysi may leverag tcpip header paramet complex analysi host behavior use machin learn howev exist approach becom obsolet network traffic evolv make problem still open paper discuss variou approach passiv os fingerprint evolut past twenti year illustr usag compar result experi list challeng face current fingerprint approach host differ network stack set initi import inform sourc os fingerprint complement host behavior analysi combin approach back machin learn impact reason evolut internetwid network traffic encrypt gener adopt privacypreserv concept applic protocol chang increas prolifer web applic handheld devic rais need identifi devic network may use techniqu os fingerprint,passiv oper system fingerprint revisit evalu current challeng fingerprint host oper system common yet precari task network asset vulner manag estim oper system via network traffic analysi may leverag tcpip header paramet complex analysi host behavior use machin learn howev exist approach becom obsolet network traffic evolv make problem still open paper discuss variou approach passiv os fingerprint evolut past twenti year illustr usag compar result experi list challeng face current fingerprint approach host differ network stack set initi import inform sourc os fingerprint complement host behavior analysi combin approach back machin learn impact reason evolut internetwid network traffic encrypt gener adopt privacypreserv concept applic protocol chang increas prolifer web applic handheld devic rais need identifi devic network may use techniqu os fingerprint,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10048287627896994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21821834093843692,0.0,0.0,0.1288316936027024,0.28468809657085387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930139804585143,0.23004976957581538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13298940255600003,0.10867251076641118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930139804585143,0.10867251076641118,0.0,0.0,0.08622697728118359,0.0,0.08710297429728286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09909393463333828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17245395456236717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1955392375938518,0.0,0.0,0.06564485737052499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08221080017323104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11750189480010947,0.0,0.0,0.07383449185796623,0.0,0.0,0.1106365761490806,0.0,0.0,0.07739759324748528,0.0,0.08147133894277198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965041812787828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06362502770609622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06649470127800002,0.0,0.0,0.07869180050707174,0.0,0.0,0.08622697728118359,0.0,0.07739759324748528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383449185796623,0.0,0.07936165863015471,0.0,0.10683525030046645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13385866086766846,0.0,0.11274625646169788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1860279609170286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537713337370856,0.08147133894277198,0.0,0.17981066499824616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07439822625428986,0.3618923007209023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965041812787828,0.21200447597246613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04786169917458983,0.10348224327216538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07869180050707174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106365761490806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106365761490806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05612615014855097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0880067853426932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10510940937689212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409367311991718,0.0,0.0,0.0880067853426932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07869180050707174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29728180390001485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08701086134105913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08147133894277198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10683525030046645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09413050225747342
"Satellite-based communications security: A survey of threats, solutions, and research challenges ","Satellite-based Communication (SATCOM) systems are gaining renewed momentum in Industry and Academia, thanks to innovative services introduced by leading tech companies and the promising impact they can deliver towards the global connectivity objective tackled by early 6G initiatives. On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services.
In this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified branches, focusing on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based key distribution schemes. For each of the above domains, we highlight the most essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned, and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers and investors, ultimately unleashing the full potential behind ubiquitous satellite communications.",Networking,satellitebas commun secur survey threat solut research challeng,satellitebas commun satcom system gain renew momentum industri academia thank

"A survey on network simulators, emulators, and testbeds used for research and education","Network operators and researchers constantly search for platforms to evaluate future deployments and test new research ideas. When experimenting, they usually face challenges in deciding on an appropriate platform to validate the advantages and limitations of their proposed system. These challenges include finding an experimentation environment that balances traffic realism, scalability, and cost. An experimenter can evaluate systems, protocols, and security implementations using simulators, emulators, or testbeds to validate the expected behavior of the proposed idea. Simulators and emulators provide a controlled environment to conduct reproducible experiments but lack realism. Testbeds provide realism and scale depending on the available resources. However, real equipment can be costly and unavailable for many experimenters. The inability to test networking ideas in a realistic environment at a large scale presents a barrier for companies, institutions, and network vendors to implement new features, thus, slowing down innovation. In the past few decades, the networking community developed new platforms to test new ideas and deployments at scale, with realism, and at lower costs. These platforms also enable the instruction of networking concepts, cybersecurity, distributed computing, storage systems, and science applications. From the learner’s side, practical hands-on experience is required to internalize concepts and improve troubleshooting skills. Learning these concepts can be challenging due to the multidisciplinary nature of networking instruction, where a learner must have a background in several computing areas (e.g., operating systems, programming languages, and computer architecture). This paper presents experimentation platforms used to conduct research in computer networks and evaluates the potential of these platforms for instructing networking courses. This paper examines the literature and presents a taxonomy of network experimentation platforms. It also discusses challenges, analyzes the limitations, and suggests future perspectives by providing an overview of the tools, a description of the underlying resources (i.e., hardware and software), and a summary of the supported experiments. The paper aims to assist experimenters and educators in deciding which platform is more suitable for their experimentation needs and discuss the challenges and future directions related to the network experimentation platforms.",Networking,survey network simul emul testb use research educ,network oper research constantli search platform evalu futur deploy test new research idea experi usual face

Efficient intrusion detection toward IoT networks using cloud–edge collaboration,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly utilized in daily life and industrial production, particularly in critical infrastructures. IoT cybersecurity has an effect on people’s safety, national security, and economic growth. However, the traditional cloud-based centralized intrusion detection methods cannot satisfy the demands for data privacy, network load, and timely response. In this article, we proposed an efficient intrusion detection method based on cloud–edge collaboration. The approach can reduce computational workload to speed up model training, prevent data privacy leakage, enrich training data, and detect attacks unknown to local edge devices. Specifically, stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is first utilized for data dimensionality reduction to overcome the bottleneck of resource constraints on edge devices. Second, considering the long-term serial characteristics of IoT traffic data, the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model is employed to detect attack; Finally, the cloud–edge collaboration architecture based on federated learning is used to coordinate multi-party training intrusion detection models. It fills the gap of missed detection by intrusion detection models due to data silos. Experiments show that our method reduced the training time, storage and memory required for the model training process by more than 50%, respectively, but the detection accuracy is close to centralized trained models. The model trained based on cloud–edge collaboration can identify attacks unknown to local edge devices.",Networking,effici intrus detect toward iot network use cloudedg collabor,internet thing iot

Implementing zero trust security with dual fuzzy methodology for trust-aware authentication and task offloading in Multi-access Edge Computing,"This paper proposes an efficient trust-aware authentication and task offloading scheme for Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) using the Zero Trust Security (ZTS) principles. The proposed method uses a dual fuzzy logic system to evaluate the trustworthiness of edge servers. Devices connected to the edge servers are authenticated using identity, biometrics and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) measures. After authentication, tasks can be offloaded from the devices to the most trustworthy edge server. The proposed scheme also considers the resource constraints of the edge servers and aims to minimise the overall task completion time. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes regarding authentication accuracy, task completion time, and energy consumption.",Networking,implement zero trust secur dual fuzzi methodolog trustawar authent task offload multiaccess edg comput,paper propos effici trustawar authent task offload scheme multiaccess edg comput mec use zero trust secur zt principl propos method use dual fuzzi logic system evalu trustworthi edg server devic connect edg server authent use ident biometr physic unclon function puf measur authent task offload devic trustworthi edg server propos scheme also consid resourc constraint edg server aim minimis overal task complet time experiment result show propos scheme outperform exist scheme regard authent accuraci task complet time energi consumpt,implement zero trust secur dual fuzzi methodolog trustawar authent task offload multiaccess edg comput paper propos effici trustawar authent task offload scheme multiaccess edg comput mec use zero trust secur zt principl propos method use dual fuzzi logic system evalu trustworthi edg server devic connect edg server authent use ident biometr physic unclon function puf measur authent task offload devic trustworthi edg server propos scheme also consid resourc constraint edg server aim minimis overal task complet time experiment result show propos scheme outperform exist scheme regard authent accuraci task complet time energi consumpt,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07341529356201308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0648884178371196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04961147972428321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47442495482347286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17154892717650155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11568148828363176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07617008500892546,0.06738758280438906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15433777223680548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5146467815295046,0.0,0.0,0.060112305669529534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07341529356201308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05827705542794526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06108938679160978,0.0,0.0,0.0804629672573168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06874977714787332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058722007100727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07256729385893636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048443979452287345,0.08577446358825078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03777690921255083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09488499096469458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08432432656807053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17815102499732932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08898984298221028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06673625241127175,0.0,0.04429998339334923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32671128494152063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309752707073172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06108938679160978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03708013011826256,0.0,0.0,0.34731574487690153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11655411085589051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1945047413111547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030156095397926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"A practical framework for cyber defense generation, enforcement and evaluation","It is challenging to enforce and evaluate cyber-defenses for large networks. The current state-of-the-art approaches on defense enforcement and evaluations are manually performed by a security expert and they are executed separately without using a defined workflow. Moreover, the cyber defense generation, enforcement, and evaluation require costs, time, and effort of the security experts to effectively identify attacks and the best set of defenses to deploy. To effectively address these challenges, we propose a novel defense automation framework named CD-GEE (Cyber Defense Generation, Enforcement and Evaluation). CD-GEE can perform automated Cyber defense generation, defense enforcement and security evaluation without human intervention. CD-GEE works in the following five phases: (1) host/network data collection, (2) graphical security models construction, (3) cyber defense generation & selection, (4) defense deployment, and (5) defense evaluation and report. To show the usability and applicability of CD-GEE, we perform experiments on different networks including Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud. Besides, we also evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the defenses deployed via our proposed framework and tool. We show that the CD-GEE measures the security posture of the network before and after defense deployment and evaluation. We also showed that our proposed framework performed better than without the framework in enhancing the security of networks on both the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and simulation network environment.",Networking,practic framework cyber defens gener enforc evalu,challeng enforc evalu cyberdefens larg network current stateoftheart approach defens enforc evalu manual perform secur expert

Designing and implementing an AUTOSAR-based Basic Software Module for enhanced security,"Electronic Control Units (ECUs) communicate with each other to accomplish the functionalities of modern vehicles. ECUs form an in-vehicle network that is precisely regulated and must be adequately protected from malicious activity, which has had several outbreaks in recent years. Therefore, we present CINNAMON, an AUTOSAR-based Basic Software Module that aims at confidentiality, integrity and authentication, all at the same time, for the traffic exchanged over the bus protocols that AUTOSAR supports. CINNAMON in fact stands for Confidential, INtegral aNd Authentic onboard coMmunicatiON.
This article introduces the requirements and specification of CINNAMON in a differential fashion with respect to the existing Secure Onboard Communication Basic Software Module, which does not include confidentiality. As a result, CINNAMON exceeds SecOC at least against information gathering attacks. The article then defines three security profiles, regulating also the freshness attribute appropriately. Most importantly, CINNAMON is not a simple academic exercise because it is implemented in a laboratory environment on commercial ECUs, thus reaching the level of TRL 4, “Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment”. The runtimes obtained on inexpensive devices are reassuring, paving the way for a possible large-scale application.",Networking,design implement autosarbas basic softwar modul enhanc secur,electron control unit ecu commun accomplish function modern vehicl ecu form invehicl network precis regul must adequ protect malici activ sever outbreak recent year therefor present cinnamon autosarbas basic softwar modul aim confidenti integr authent time traffic exchang bu protocol autosar support cinnamon fact stand confidenti integr authent onboard commun articl introduc requir specif cinnamon differenti fashion respect exist secur onboard commun basic softwar modul includ confidenti result cinnamon exce secoc least inform gather attack articl defin three secur profil regul also fresh attribut appropri importantli cinnamon simpl academ exercis implement laboratori environ commerci ecu thu reach level trl 4 compon andor breadboard valid laboratori environ runtim obtain inexpens devic reassur pave way possibl largescal applic,design implement autosarbas basic softwar modul enhanc secur electron control unit ecu commun accomplish function modern vehicl ecu form invehicl network precis regul must adequ protect malici activ sever outbreak recent year therefor present cinnamon autosarbas basic softwar modul aim confidenti integr authent time traffic exchang bu protocol autosar support cinnamon fact stand confidenti integr authent onboard commun articl introduc requir specif cinnamon differenti fashion respect exist secur onboard commun basic softwar modul includ confidenti result cinnamon exce secoc least inform gather attack articl defin three secur profil regul also fresh attribut appropri importantli cinnamon simpl academ exercis implement laboratori environ commerci ecu thu reach level trl 4 compon andor breadboard valid laboratori environ runtim obtain inexpens devic reassur pave way possibl largescal applic,0.0,0.1182748842504316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757501594866713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08624209068908216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593777250573692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06757454361166836,0.0,0.1182748842504316,0.0,0.0,0.1907237706162781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943139322629552,0.2522200500049418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12326372016981868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24975971574522096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11207402586751276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08255053328173095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182748842504316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07114459185534158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10256385186805424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08471028839894199,0.0,0.19515003189733426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08119286324790896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11400137827607217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0913741575657483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1560928384642713,0.0,0.0,0.07687514764690268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325323858174032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651010665634619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08869801614133273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11207402586751276,0.0,0.0,0.09536188530813905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1160617536099035,0.36199574232863546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10694195899084662,0.0,0.0,0.06327300985735765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09232228790847488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11026355657233261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06515184300691608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11400137827607217,0.1160617536099035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09045520514165552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26554778833855447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07260164167254324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05887835322051137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2611155014456032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395310688350477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2079187551760132,0.0,0.0,0.08703850048186773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08255053328173095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09874628753390009,0.0,0.10395310688350477,0.0,0.11400137827607217,0.07745504154416942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395310688350477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1160617536099035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11207402586751276,0.0,0.0,0.10855660071647977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10123636232931842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09874628753390009
Game theoretic solution for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle network host under DDoS attack,"Game theory is being used in cybersecurity to observe different attacks as it can provide a mathematical representation of the interactions between system admins, hackers, and users. The game-theoretic solution determines the favorable parameters (strategies), predicts the player’s behavior, and suggests the best settings for minimizing the attack’s effect. To this end, our paper attempts to study the usefulness of game-theoretic applications for the prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on a drone by deriving the information from conventional game solutions and augmenting that with the bounded rationality concept called Quantal response equilibrium (QRE). In this process, we identify feasible strategies for each player through simulations and formulate five non-cooperative game scenarios for two variants of DDoS attacks. In these games, the traditional game-theoretic solution or Nash Equilibrium (NashE) provides information about the drone’s recommended settings, the hacker’s preferred strategy, and the game-theoretic threshold assuming that all participants are highly intelligent. We augment this information by considering the participant’s tendency to make errors and the evolution in their behavioral pattern from zero to high-values of rationality using QRE. The information coupled from NashE and QRE provides better clarity to a drone operator, thus improving the drone’s security by two levels and allowing the drone operator to take timely precautions. Inspired by this multilevel process, we propose an equivalent real-world framework for protecting Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) nodes against a DDoS attack.",Networking,game theoret solut unman aerial

Evaluating Federated Learning for intrusion detection in Internet of Things: Review and challenges,"The application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to the well-known intrusion detection systems (IDS) is key to cope with increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks through an effective and efficient detection process. In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), most ML-enabled IDS approaches use centralized approaches where IoT devices share their data with data centers for further analysis. To mitigate privacy concerns associated with centralized approaches, in recent years the use of Federated Learning (FL) has attracted a significant interest in different sectors, including healthcare and transport systems. However, the development of FL-enabled IDS for IoT is in its infancy, and still requires research efforts from various areas, in order to identify the main challenges for the deployment in real-world scenarios. In this direction, our work evaluates a FL-enabled IDS approach based on a multiclass classifier considering different data distributions for the detection of different attacks in an IoT scenario. In particular, we use three different settings that are obtained by partitioning the recent ToN_IoT dataset according to IoT devices’ IP address and types of attack. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of different aggregation functions according to such setting by using the recent IBMFL framework as FL implementation. Additionally, we identify a set of challenges and future directions based on the existing literature and the analysis of our evaluation results.",Networking,evalu feder learn intrus detect internet

FedSBS: Federated-Learning participant-selection method for Intrusion Detection Systems,"Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach in which multiple participants collaboratively train a model. Participants keep data locally, train their local models, and aggregate them in a single global model in a federated server. Collaborative FL-based Intrusion Detection Systems face challenges on an uneven statistical distribution of data and malicious participants trying to subvert the learning process. The statistical hurdles associated with imbalanced data and malicious participants pose a risk of skewing the training with biased or random data. The inability to effectively manage these statistical inconsistencies may degrade system performance, leading to false intrusion detection or opening avenues for cybersecurity breaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a training method that employs score-based participant selection and utilizes global momentum for model aggregation. Our method improves the global model performance while mitigating the risks posed by malicious participants. The proposal incorporates a scoring system based on an information gain variant to evaluate each participant’s contribution. The scoring system and an epsilon greedy selection method ensure robust participant selection in each aggregation round. Furthermore, incorporating a global momentum term helps preserve previous knowledge at each aggregation round, contributing to model stability and overall learning. The proposed solution has demonstrated superior performance, delivering 80% F1-Score and 90% accuracy on experiments even in the presence of malicious participants, revealing the robustness and effectiveness of the proposal in mitigating statistical challenges. Consequently, the proposed method significantly enhances the performance of federated learning models, leading to more secure and efficient collaborative intrusion detection systems.",Networking,fedsb

Performance of Some Image Processing Algorithms in Tensorflow,"Signal, image and Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery algorithms in recent time are used in a daily routine. Due to huge data and complexity, their processing is almost impossible in a real time. Often image processing algorithms are inherently parallel in nature, so they fit nicely into parallel architectures multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit GPUs. In this paper image processing algorithms were evaluated, which are capable to execute in parallel manner on several platforms CPU and GPU. All algorithms were tested in TensorFlow, which is a novel framework for deep learning, but also for image processing. Relative speedups compared to CPU were given for all algorithms. TensorFlow GPU implementation can outperform multi-core CPUs for tested algorithms, obtained speedups range from 3.6 to 15 times.",Image Processing,perform imag process algorithm tensorflow,signal imag synthet apertur radar imageri algorithm recent time use daili routin due huge data complex process almost imposs real time often imag process algorithm inher parallel natur fit nice parallel architectur multicor central process unit cpu graphic process unit gpu paper imag process algorithm evalu capabl execut parallel manner sever platform cpu gpu algorithm test tensorflow novel framework deep learn also imag process rel speedup compar cpu given algorithm tensorflow gpu implement outperform multicor cpu test algorithm obtain speedup rang 36 15 time,perform imag process algorithm tensorflow signal imag synthet apertur radar imageri algorithm recent time use daili routin due huge data complex process almost imposs real time often imag process algorithm inher parallel natur fit nice parallel architectur multicor central process unit cpu graphic process unit gpu paper imag process algorithm evalu capabl execut parallel manner sever platform cpu gpu algorithm test tensorflow novel framework deep learn also imag process rel speedup compar cpu given algorithm tensorflow gpu implement outperform multicor cpu test algorithm obtain speedup rang 36 15 time,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5751609181445397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06618090873363236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10160965712420196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09171108687278134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078874594135021,0.0,0.09171108687278134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06314299794139087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10895688785704188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902507755464535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774064607578893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08989394172765325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12657503791712818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3618695269451777,0.0,0.07833420438549668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0704701726579954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433641929041795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10294204159321452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266271331230228,0.0,0.11067013787164781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05039378375184442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07493732265429312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11248728301677594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41813255061510374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10294204159321452,0.0,0.0,0.10433641929041795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078874594135021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433641929041795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11648971494228226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17471888533090896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23322193822736678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23297942988456452,0.0,0.04580705037746532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An Automatic Nuclei Cells Counting Approach Using Effective Image Processing Methods,"Manual counting of nuclei cells from histological images is considered tedious process, time-consuming and subjected to human errors. Therefore, automated the process of nuclei cells counting is become important and necessary for effective analyzing of histological images. Current systems and approaches of nuclei cells counting are based on color or grayscale images leading to inaccurate results and have several limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel accurate approach for automatic nuclei cells counting using effective image processing methods. The new techniques are designed based on image thresholding method, morphological image processing operations, and connected component algorithm. The new approach was evaluated experimentally on 37 images of a public data set of 100 histological images. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach achieved a high accuracy up to 89.5% compared with previous works. We concluded the effectiveness of the proposed approach for automatic counting of nuclei cells from histological images.",Image Processing,automat nuclei cell count approach use effect imag process method,manual count nuclei cell histolog imag consid tediou process timeconsum subject human error therefor autom process nuclei cell count becom import necessari effect analyz histolog imag current system approach nuclei cell count base color grayscal imag lead inaccur result sever limit paper propos novel accur approach automat nuclei cell count use effect imag process method new techniqu design base imag threshold method morpholog imag process oper connect compon algorithm new approach evalu experiment 37 imag public data set 100 histolog imag experiment result demonstr approach achiev high accuraci 895 compar previou work conclud effect propos approach automat count nuclei cell histolog imag,automat nuclei cell count approach use effect imag process method manual count nuclei cell histolog imag consid tediou process timeconsum subject human error therefor autom process nuclei cell count becom import necessari effect analyz histolog imag current system approach nuclei cell count base color grayscal imag lead inaccur result sever limit paper propos novel accur approach automat nuclei cell count use effect imag process method new techniqu design base imag threshold method morpholog imag process oper connect compon algorithm new approach evalu experiment 37 imag public data set 100 histolog imag experiment result demonstr approach achiev high accuraci 895 compar previou work conclud effect propos approach automat count nuclei cell histolog imag,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08156728257177953,0.0701966524378958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06843373393365342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07209358781471449,0.0,0.0,0.37447974438918785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09074727623238378,0.2810629436648495,0.0,0.09791523511252455,0.08156728257177953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561551700651795,0.0,0.0,0.09368764788828318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08462796436537369,0.07487025852170513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561551700651795,0.0,0.0,0.05259011329184092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07487025852170513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059472919075631896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22455760251650725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529880723062005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06474810379294117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17879505123268596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07971722853315978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763837100866547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6027828908781323,0.0,0.0,0.06787271470022761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08573767173528189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561551700651795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16146950733971238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266423674039827,0.0,0.08573767173528189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06197143308595054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04197163395969812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887122037340802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2487510087620644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09896640258023962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09368764788828318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09843805256511667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07717629428280531,0.08689901160602433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09702116633478827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041197484943649956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06900765128426317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08254640042722784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630293294442526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06378781981635996,0.0

OpenCLIPER: An OpenCL-Based C++ Framework for Overhead-Reduced Medical Image Processing and Reconstruction on Heterogeneous Devices,"Medical image processing is often limited by the computational cost of the involved algorithms. Whereas dedicated computing devices (GPUs in particular) exist and do provide significant efficiency boosts, they have an extra cost of use in terms of housekeeping tasks (device selection and initialization, data streaming, synchronization with the CPU, and others), which may hinder developers from using them. This paper describes an OpenCL-based framework that is capable of handling dedicated computing devices seamlessly and that allows the developer to concentrate on image processing tasks. The framework handles automatically device discovery and initialization, data transfers to and from the device and the file system and kernel loading and compiling. Data structures need to be defined only once independently of the computing device; code is unique, consequently, for every device, including the host CPU. Pinned memory/buffer mapping is used to achieve maximum performance in data transfers. Code fragments included in the paper show how the computing device is almost immediately and effortlessly available to the users algorithms, so they can focus on productive work. Code required for device selection and initialization, data loading and streaming and kernel compilation is minimal and systematic. Algorithms can be thought of as mathematical operators (called processes), with input, output and parameters, and they may be chained one after another easily and efficiently. Also for efficiency, processes can have their initialization work split from their core workload, so process chains and loops do not incur in performance penalties. Algorithm code is independent of the device type targeted.",Image Processing,openclip openclbas c framework overheadreduc medic imag process reconstruct heterogen devic,medic imag process often limit

Design of Image Processing System Based on DSP Core,"In recent years, with the development of digital technology, digital image processing has been widely and deeply applied in the field of computer graphics. Digital image processing system is a complex real-time system, it from the camera, fax machine and other scanning equipment to obtain image information, after digital transformation, digital image information coding, filtering, enhancement, recovery, compression, storage and other processing, finally generate visual image. This design uses TMS320C6748 as the core processor of the system, SAA7113 as the video decoding chip of the system, CPLD as the sampling controller, DDR2 chip as the external expansion memory. The ROM expansion uses NAND flash memory chip. On the basis of hardware design, combined with software algorithm to complete image processing. The system can be used in information communication, image recognition, news scene and other fields of image processing and transmission.

Research on Applications of Image Processing Technologies in Interior Design Information System,"Due to the limitations of software technology and weak image processing technology, traditional interior design has limited scene reproduction ability and supports a small range of scenes. Therefore, this article proposes an interior design system based on image processing and virtual reality technology. The system hardware consists of an image processing module, a virtual simulation module, and a database support module, mainly responsible for processing image information. The system software mainly consists of program loading module, data storage and reading/writing module, bus transmission module, etc. After testing, the system's denoised image is smooth and clear, with obvious edge segmentation. After image rendering, the reflection and light effects are good, and the image processing time is short, which has a good indoor design effect.",Image Processing,research applic imag process technolog interior design inform system,due limit softwar technolog weak imag process technolog tradit interior design limit scene reproduct abil support small rang scene therefor articl propos interior design system base imag process virtual realiti technolog system hardwar consist imag process modul virtual simul modul databas support modul mainli respons process imag inform system softwar mainli consist program load modul data storag readingwrit modul bu transmiss modul etc test system denois imag smooth clear obviou edg segment imag render reflect light effect good imag process time short good indoor design effect,research applic imag process technolog interior design inform system due limit softwar technolog weak imag process technolog tradit interior design limit scene reproduct abil support small rang scene therefor articl propos interior design system base imag process virtual realiti technolog system hardwar consist imag process modul virtual simul modul databas support modul mainli respons process imag inform system softwar mainli consist program load modul data storag readingwrit modul bu transmiss modul etc test system denois imag smooth clear obviou edg segment imag render reflect light effect good imag process time short good indoor design effect,0.08201476507597391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05182353466988102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07313390080518738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04491452615576856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09453207279458528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16912425719628435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04824703768043314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21824574909615446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06802331867848979,0.0,0.08742869820113884,0.0,0.10300642489510027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09070608896380347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17801763772508666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44240237609573146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127695338079226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13874184594330993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07666436227048047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5552356819670186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27384993585060885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07396681679668766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045396705345437306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865715473722934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0474338398697082,0.0,0.0,0.07972258709696896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09253928032783643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06330875792706415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10630319487669762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09253928032783643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266175158541283,0.0,0.18897626226674538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20601284979020054,0.06675062096250191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07572942978265966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059400978775211846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325304856226205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08456212859814217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18906414558917056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Design of an Access Control System for Unmanned Bathroom Based on Image Processing Technology,"In order to improve the efficiency and intelligence of the access control management system, this paper uses image processing technology to identify the ID card number, and uses the gender results after identification as the basis for identifying the switch of the male and female bathroom access control system, and compares the membership information in the database with the chip information in the second-generation ID card and the image recognition information to verify the authenticity of the ID card. Therefore, an intelligent bathroom access control system based on image processing technology is developed. The system is mainly composed of image acquisition and reading module, image processing module, magnetic card induction module, signal processing module and signal execution module.

Application of image processing technology in gas pipeline inner wall damage detection,"In order to detect the damage of gas pipeline, this paper uses image processing technology as a research tool, and proposes an image processing system for pipeline damage detection. Because the environment of the gas pipeline may be dark, humid, even sand and other complex environmental factors, as well as the noise generated by the electronic devices themselves, resulting in the quality of the image transmitted from the front end is greatly reduced, so this paper first uses image processing technology to denoise the image. In order to distinguish the damaged and intact inner wall of the pipeline and facilitate the measurement of the target area, the image segmentation processing is also needed for the image. The purpose is to provide high-quality and easy to process images for the follow-up work. Finally, the image features of gas pipeline inner wall damage can be extracted to complete the image processing.",Image Processing,applic imag process technolog ga pipelin inner wall damag detect,order detect damag ga pipelin paper use imag process technolog research tool propos imag process system pipelin damag detect environ ga pipelin may dark humid even sand complex environment factor well nois gener electron devic result qualiti imag transmit front end greatli reduc paper first use imag process technolog denois imag order distinguish damag intact inner wall pipelin facilit measur target area imag segment process also need imag purpos provid highqual easi process imag followup work final imag featur ga pipelin inner wall damag extract complet imag process,applic imag process technolog ga pipelin inner wall damag detect order detect damag ga pipelin paper use imag process technolog research tool propos imag process system pipelin damag detect environ ga pipelin may dark humid even sand complex environment factor well nois gener electron devic result qualiti imag transmit front end greatli reduc paper first use imag process technolog denois imag order distinguish damag intact inner wall pipelin facilit measur target area imag segment process also need imag purpos provid highqual easi process imag followup work final imag featur ga pipelin inner wall damag extract complet imag process,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060365065093899446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061863505071452045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494527808616894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043665923023197,0.0836517031095753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21942602386697657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09389570437426412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062528357469822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08932849814978355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062528357469822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026021293976705,0.0,0.09790379732936709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09268040714216114,0.0,0.08043155189523828,0.0,0.08932849814978355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06110402051075415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7261521718056304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08634302379291887,0.0,0.08829668943211738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07145035384511556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18303368129290876,0.0,0.0,0.0919305610852714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38138791259800225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05419158166756368,0.0,0.0,0.06304381869541818,0.0,0.0789533710412719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08281041562304803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05662337800828502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05390227012094684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046726693454957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04511747040642257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18444337682142928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08120173482665716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835632399344801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08199424498351338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06985730019177865,0.0

"Determining Image Deblur, Detecting Faces, and Enhancing Appearance Using Image Processing Techniques","This paper explores the utilization of MATLAB for digital signal processing (DSP) techniques in image processing tasks, focusing on image deblurring, face detection, and facial feature enhancement. Blind deconvolution methods are employed to address image blurriness, while face detection is facilitated using cascaded object detectors. Enhancements to detected facial features involve histogram equalization, smoothing filters, skin tone adjustment, and contrast enhancement techniques, followed by seamless integration using resizing methods.

Evaluation of NVIDIA Xavier NX Platform for Real-Time Image Processing for Fusion Diagnostics,"Real-time image processing is the core component of image plasma diagnostics. Efficient algorithms enable machine protection, contributing to future steady-state operation in nuclear fusion devices. The paper evaluates the applicability of the newest low-power NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform for fusion diagnostics. This embedded NVIDIA Tegra System-on-a-Chip (SoC) integrates a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) on a single chip. General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) provides high parallelism that is advantageous in image-based calculations. The hardware differences in comparison to the previous NVIDIA Jetson TX2 based on Pascal architecture, including innovations introduced in the Volta architecture for NVIDIA Tegra, are signified. The evaluation is performed on the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator experimental data. Implemented algorithms detect and analyse thermal events in real-time utilising the embedded GPU. Investigated thermal events are strike-lines, overload hotspots, reflections and surface layers. Their detection allows the automated real-time risk evaluation incorporated in the feedback plasma control and interlock systems in the W7-X. The speedup resulting from the upgrade to the Xavier NX platform is presented in the paper, along with techniques pertaining to key hardware differences and programming aspects specific to the NVIDIA Tegra facilitating real-time computing on the low-power embedded device.",Image Processing,evalu nvidia xavier nx platform realtim imag process fusion diagnost,realtim imag process core compon imag

Fast controling autonomous vehicle based on real time image processing,"In this paper, a method for Autonomous Vehicle is presented based on real time image processing. The system detects the road by sobel edge detection, and it recognizes the obstacles, humans, and traffic lights by heuristic techniques. For this aim, some features are defined based on key points. One important technique is that every frame is divided in some sections which significantly affect time of processing. The system is able to analyze 30 frames per second to get the best decision for controlling the vehicle. The achieved structure is optimized on accuracy and the number of logic cells.

Hotspot Detection of Solar Photovoltaic System: A Perspective from Image Processing,"Research in solar energy has rapidly grown since its significant and contributes to the advancement in clean renewable energy technology. Effective energy management such as fault detection impacts the early-stage monitoring for the efficiency, reliability, and safety of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The formation of a hotspot is one of the issues commonly occurred in a PV system. However, the main limitation of hotspot detection is the difficulty to interpret specific components with erratic temperatures in the thermographic images for attributes in the intelligence detection model. In this study, a review of hotspot detection in solar PV panels using the image processing method is established based on the image processing field. The integration of image processing approach can further assist in developing automated fault detection in solar PV farms for effective preventive monitoring methods. Therefore, several aspects need to be categorized and considered accordingly for achieving accurate prediction. Several ways were discussed, and future research is suggested in this study.",Image Processing,hotspot detect solar photovolta system perspect imag process,research solar energi rapidli grown sinc signific contribut advanc clean renew energi technolog effect energi manag fault detect impact earlystag monitor effici reliabl safeti solar photovolta pv system format hotspot one issu commonli occur pv system howev main limit hotspot detect difficulti interpret specif compon errat temperatur thermograph imag attribut intellig detect model studi review hotspot detect solar pv panel use imag process method establish base imag process field integr imag process approach assist develop autom fault detect solar pv farm effect prevent monitor method therefor sever aspect need categor consid accordingli achiev accur predict sever way discuss futur research suggest studi,hotspot detect solar photovolta system perspect imag process research solar energi rapidli grown sinc signific contribut advanc clean renew energi technolog effect energi manag fault detect impact earlystag monitor effici reliabl safeti solar photovolta pv system format hotspot one issu commonli occur pv system howev main limit hotspot detect difficulti interpret specif compon errat temperatur thermograph imag attribut intellig detect model studi review hotspot detect solar pv panel use imag process method establish base imag process field integr imag process approach assist develop autom fault detect solar pv farm effect prevent monitor method therefor sever aspect need categor consid accordingli achiev accur predict sever way discuss futur research suggest studi,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08031036314828287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08565732755139055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07140559941035968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10902915666898032,0.0,0.11099966780197028,0.0,0.0,0.10382185554201538,0.0,0.0,0.05601127558463998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071858666062911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08565732755139055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09020038750639948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45845770769526717,0.0,0.0,0.054001123802595946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11311627174995698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08248060294876215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12845557430080953,0.07640961794921121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.279957712662455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09560534397625059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23577503467459926,0.0,0.08248060294876215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08324227696870297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06671292631564853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3448149675572028,0.08650996051145383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0789500544851818,0.0776515998431345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11788751733729963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829560962005088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08650996051145383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09941914517192978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173871492411115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12315568070998213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06268356875295686,0.0,0.0,0.20764371108403076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07464238940433467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08101561090741023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10902915666898032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382185554201538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22767221117682024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08923212247317502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118306040578753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08923212247317502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11311627174995698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19883829034385955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482941210308942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08324227696870297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12243715342320985,0.0,0.0,0.10382185554201538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413992631435355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06422778715040477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09443942360013996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043648208577092354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968208926586077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Weakly Supervised Estimation of Shadow Confidence Maps in Fetal Ultrasound Imaging,"Detecting acoustic shadows in ultrasound images is important in many clinical and engineering applications. Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can guide sonographers to a standardized diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional information for other automatic image analysis algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions using learning-based algorithms is challenging because pixel-wise ground truth annotation of acoustic shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of acoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense shadow-focused confidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general shadow features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level annotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained binary shadow segmentation to a reference confidence map. In addition, a confidence estimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and the reference confidence maps. This network is able to predict shadow confidence maps directly from input images during inference. We use evaluation metrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation, and so on, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method is more consistent than human annotation and outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow segmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow confidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view image fusion, and automated biometric measurements.",Image Processing,weakli supervis estim shadow confid map fetal ultrasound imag,detect acoust shadow ultrasound imag import mani clinic engin applic realtim feedback acoust shadow guid

SAR real-time imaging pipeline technology based on multi-core DSP,"According to the characteristics of SAR imaging, a SAR real-time imaging pipeline technology based on multicore DSP is proposed. The algorithm uses sub-aperture complex image stitching technology for real-time data processing, uses ECS operation to process the range direction of each subaperture data, and uses the Dechirp operation to process the azimuth direction. This technology is based on TI’s multi-core DSP C6678 chip to achieve a pipeline design, and coherently splices the processed sub-aperture image data in the complex image domain to obtain a full-resolution image of the recorded data. The algorithm is optimized for the KeystoneII hardware architecture of the chip to meet the performance requirements of real-time processing of SAR imaging. In this paper, the banding mode of SAR is verified, and the imaging results of the measured data test the effectiveness and real-time performance of the technology.",Image Processing,sar realtim imag pipelin technolog base multicor dsp,accord characterist sar imag sar realtim imag pipelin technolog base multicor dsp propos algorithm use subapertur complex imag stitch technolog realtim data process use ec oper process rang direct subapertur data use dechirp oper process azimuth direct technolog base ti multicor dsp c6678 chip achiev pipelin design coher splice process subapertur imag data complex imag domain obtain fullresolut imag record data algorithm optim keystoneii hardwar architectur chip meet perform requir realtim process sar imag paper band mode sar verifi imag result measur data test effect realtim perform technolog,sar realtim imag pipelin technolog base multicor dsp accord characterist sar imag sar realtim imag pipelin technolog base multicor dsp propos algorithm use subapertur complex imag stitch technolog realtim data process use ec oper process rang direct subapertur data use dechirp oper process azimuth direct technolog base ti multicor dsp c6678 chip achiev pipelin design coher splice process subapertur imag data complex imag domain obtain fullresolut imag record data algorithm optim keystoneii hardwar architectur chip meet perform requir realtim process sar imag paper band mode sar verifi imag result measur data test effect realtim perform technolog,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09861831268628335,0.0,0.07135221808984317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391205574270461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08602109588117311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14929064921396729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08832952872489888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552822521112721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2672792150800086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06045195240725191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658200593028717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08832952872489888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057063558132867113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5514352225831968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08195235888400765,0.0,0.09861831268628335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09861831268628335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.078446757641392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12598319308177575,0.0,0.07135221808984317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0426625640379215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268814559475167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25284590661872514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050297785544117526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08714907106978555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47614959205949275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06169001567963059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050029261731388865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2853177906643356,0.07395709429926813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11633852876022938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08832952872489888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Modelling and Simulation of Smart Traffic Light System for Emergency Vehicle using Image Processing Techniques,"traffic signal due to the drawbacks of the conventional traffic light system. In the existing traffic light system, a defined timer system is used and it is working based on preset timing. Due to the preset timing, there is no flexibility of ON/OFF in the signal light based on the emergency vehicle and congestion of the vehicle. Sometimes emergency vehicle like an ambulance needs to wait at a traffic signal for a long time and this would lead to a risk to a patient's life. Traffic police must personally identify an ambulance and release the congestion, but this is not possible as there are an enormous number of vehicles present these days. This project aims to providea solution for the issue in the conventional system. The model was designed using an image processing system that reads the image and determines the presence of an emergency vehicle and the density of vehicles in each lane the ON/OFF signal for the particular lane will be given to the traffic light system which helpsto reduce the unnecessary waiting time of vehicles. The system calculates the vehicle's density and to detect the emergency vehicle using image processing to provide the green light signal tothe lane. This project used Open CV and Yolo (you only look once)algorithm in the image processing method to develop the system. The simulation has been done on the proposed smart traffic systemand it identifies that the proposed system is efficient. Multiple times of programming and testing have been done on the proposedsystem to ensure accuracy and for validation.",Image Processing,model simul smart traffic light system emerg vehicl use imag

Quantitative evaluation of morphological characteristics of road coarse aggregates based on image processing technology,"To quantitatively characterize and evaluate the morphological features of coarse aggregate particles, 2D images of coarse aggregate particles were processed by using Image Pro-Plus software in this paper. Through image enhancement, correction, segmentation, and retrieval, six morphological indicators such as axial coefficient, rectangularity, roundness, roughness, angular parameters, and fractal dimension were obtained. Further statistical analysis of the distribution pattern of each morphological characteristic parameter was carried out in a large sample to provide a basis for the quality control of coarse aggregates processing. What’s more, further statistical analysis of the distribution pattern of each morphological characteristic parameter was carried out in a large sample to provide a basis for the quality control of coarse aggregates processing. The axial coefficient of coarse aggregates of different particle sizes, decreases with increasing particle size. The roundness decreases with increasing particle size, and the fractal dimension decreases with increasing particle size; the axial coefficient and rectangularity can be used to characterize the shape of coarse aggregates without the influence of angles. Roughness and fractal dimension can be used to characterize coarse aggregate angles independent of shape; angular parameters, roughness or angular parameters, and fractal dimension can be chosen when characterizing angles only. This study can provide a fast and efficient quantitative basis for the optimization of the coarse aggregate processing and process control of incoming quality.",Image Processing,quantit evalu morpholog characterist road coars aggreg base imag process technolog,quantit character evalu morpholog featur coars aggreg particl 2d imag coars aggreg particl process use imag proplu softwar paper imag enhanc correct segment retriev six morpholog indic axial coeffici rectangular round rough angular paramet fractal dimens obtain statist analysi distribut pattern morpholog characterist paramet carri larg sampl provid basi qualiti control coars aggreg process what statist analysi distribut pattern morpholog characterist paramet carri larg sampl provid basi qualiti control coars aggreg process axial coeffici coars aggreg differ particl size decreas increas particl size round decreas increas particl size fractal dimens decreas increas particl size axial coeffici rectangular use character shape coars aggreg without influenc angl rough fractal dimens use character coars aggreg angl independ shape angular paramet rough angular paramet fractal dimens chosen character angl studi provid fast effici quantit basi optim coars aggreg process process control incom qualiti,quantit evalu morpholog characterist road coars aggreg base imag process technolog quantit character evalu morpholog featur coars aggreg particl 2d imag coars aggreg particl process use imag proplu softwar paper imag enhanc correct segment retriev six morpholog indic axial coeffici rectangular round rough angular paramet fractal dimens obtain statist analysi distribut pattern morpholog characterist paramet carri larg sampl provid basi qualiti control coars aggreg process what statist analysi distribut pattern morpholog characterist paramet carri larg sampl provid basi qualiti control coars aggreg process axial coeffici coars aggreg differ particl size decreas increas particl size round decreas increas particl size fractal dimens decreas increas particl size axial coeffici rectangular use character shape coars aggreg without influenc angl rough fractal dimens use character coars aggreg angl independ shape angular paramet rough angular paramet fractal dimens chosen character angl studi provid fast effici quantit basi optim coars aggreg process process control incom qualiti,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6650465651435633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493510807483882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03259415786743415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11903508415410449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17356237359114207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378281700964274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07018534904587923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03832551171921802,0.0,0.0,0.29557625117491704,0.0,0.0,0.07568746006512789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0444643890722227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0471447147753745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08621375066786474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582477510661709,0.0,0.056342145884747036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605241568995186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293206260017971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969165770894077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051381101553532385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04673431603767899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027943150249589162,0.30208077876326617,0.0,0.13164955021323418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19873098538645206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497653515765406,0.0,0.14399167482539965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12689279105068244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715510927319124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27440505938026105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03857174295468652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13431021854638248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03562439764012213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037375521482148504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07619947516688498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059517542077052246,0.0,0.0

Image Correction Technology Supporting Power Device Monitoring,"An automatically monitoring method of electrical device is proposed in this paper. Various visualization monitoring systems are built to save maintenance costs and improve operation efficiency. Limited to the working principle of ordinary camera lens, obtained image is easy to produce image deformity and aberration. In order to solve this problem, an image correction method based on phase-only correlation (POC) in power industry is suggested to get the image information of the actual situation of device. Experimental results show that proposed method can effectively save testing cost and achieve a high correction accuracy of device image.",Image Processing,imag correct technolog support power devic monitor,automat monitor method electr devic propos paper variou visual monitor system built save mainten cost improv oper effici limit work principl ordinari camera len obtain imag easi produc imag deform aberr order solv problem imag correct method base phaseonli correl poc power industri suggest get imag inform actual situat devic experiment result show propos method effect save test cost achiev high correct accuraci devic imag,imag correct technolog support power devic monitor automat monitor method electr devic propos paper variou visual monitor system built save mainten cost improv oper effici limit work principl ordinari camera len obtain imag easi produc imag deform aberr order solv problem imag correct method base phaseonli correl poc power industri suggest get imag inform actual situat devic experiment result show propos method effect save test cost achiev high correct accuraci devic imag,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09935733331198687,0.08550673718374859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11412118394726034,0.0,0.05963540983994077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38524069915844034,0.1964193685992947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41774918371221487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838355973591223,0.08135359951281126,0.0,0.0,0.10054999948950584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10889537409945481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09710377735223584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4405509075360261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880886862024271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08862835654469182,0.08477395258044362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921074711562615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19668645509130514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316185272143187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400865828885221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754875746598989,0.0,0.0,0.10179135917546811,0.0,0.0,0.05112576382954342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16142676901540887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11412118394726034,0.0,0.08405841157812535,0.0,0.1284135663861468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205512496900952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05995383253505021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08267594217479865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12043530797975055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11608374161435454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11053950907143958,0.0,0.08405841157812535,0.0,0.05018277076424231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838355973591223,0.08862835654469182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08702750854019464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07770012037806653,0.0
Study of GAN-based image reconstruction for diffractive optical systems,"In previous works, the generative adversarial network (GAN) was successfully used to remove the image-wise color distortion of images captured by diffractive optics. It showed good image quality for a test sample. However, some reconstruction artifacts were produced by GAN for real scene images. In the paper, we study the nature of these artifacts. We show how overexposure and cross-like markers affect the occurrence of artifacts.",Image Processing,studi ganbas imag reconstruct diffract optic system,previou work gener adversari network gan success use remov imagewis color distort imag captur diffract optic show good imag qualiti test sampl howev reconstruct artifact produc gan real scene imag paper studi natur artifact show overexposur crosslik marker affect occurr artifact,studi ganbas imag reconstruct diffract optic system previou work gener adversari network gan success use remov imagewis color distort imag captur diffract optic show good imag qualiti test sampl howev reconstruct artifact produc gan real scene imag paper studi natur artifact show overexposur crosslik marker affect occurr artifact,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23606391018623318,0.2046832392803785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21600800226904013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189775129052836,0.0,0.0,0.21196611348216413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12739569397070757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5267697822229442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18985182771365877,0.0,0.11555687873596238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09169714674666038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21600800226904013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23031749081405706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575058123228393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18985182771365877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20820320504555165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.296568596111227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338072542995176,0.0,0.19531043354427208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000583170287356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15896031290778903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335107046492353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13935986099485084,0.0
Signal Processing for Circular-Track Ringmap SAR Equipped on Multi-rotors UAV,"Due to the limited radius of the arc, traditional ground-based Arc SAR often suffers from poor azimuth resolution. To provide high-resolution wide-swath imaging, a circular-track ringmap SAR equipped on multi-rotors UAV platform is proposed in this paper. In this paper, we put forward “ring-map mode” for the first time to describe a new data collection geometry. We begin with a brief description of the geometry model and discussion of its achievable image resolution. Then, an image formation processing flowchart based on sub-aperture processing strategy is proposed. Finally, simulation data processing verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Image Processing,signal process circulartrack ringmap sar equip multirotor uav,due limit radiu arc tradit groundbas arc sar often suffer poor azimuth resolut provid highresolut wideswath imag circulartrack ringmap sar equip multirotor uav platform propos paper paper put forward ringmap mode first time describ new data collect geometri begin brief descript geometri model discuss achiev imag resolut imag format process flowchart base subapertur process strategi propos final simul data process verifi effect propos approach,signal process circulartrack ringmap sar equip multirotor uav due limit radiu arc tradit groundbas arc sar often suffer poor azimuth resolut provid highresolut wideswath imag circulartrack ringmap sar equip multirotor uav platform propos paper paper put forward ringmap mode first time describ new data collect geometri begin brief descript geometri model discuss achiev imag resolut imag format process flowchart base subapertur process strategi propos final simul data process verifi effect propos approach,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11992830068110398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10663072436353659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364222046218585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15747609533779103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17969640148573096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16891770524442415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12316914235008533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12667664349265378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09591202265184108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3378354104888483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547513974601895,0.0,0.13935458815024623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089494666997743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12918622391199955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16575695855189237,0.09360602525590743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10818182484149631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15747609533779103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14341386840488476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16006176955506432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33998528120625615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536204806163106,0.0,0.0,0.09834986114943524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16575695855189237,0.0,0.0,0.11789693760450727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13774494193567421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11061966333909047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1550382568401969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906401512921405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14846364364736972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Utilization of Image Processing Strategy to Detect Crack on Walls,"The development of cracks on wall structures has drawn researchers' attention to work on an effective way to detect and resolve it. This paper proposes a method of detecting cracks on wall structure through a series of image processing. The series of image processing included: image conversion from Red, Green, Blue (RGB) model to grayscale; image enhancement; image segmentation; and noise removal. The simulation was run using MATLAB software.

Research on Fire Detection and Image Information Processing System Based on Image Processing,"In this paper, based on digital image processing technology, a series of preprocessing operations such as graying based on color components, filtering denoising, histogram equalization and so on are carried out to enhance the image effect. Then, the suspicious fire area obtained based on color component difference image is processed by threshold segmentation and edge detection. In the processing of flame image, pattern recognition technology is of great significance to the extraction of flame image. Computer vision theory is the key to fire location. With this scheme, the system can effectively eliminate the interference of distance and light intensity in fire detection, and improve the recognition accuracy.",Image Processing,research fire detect imag inform process system base imag process,paper base digit imag process technolog seri preprocess oper gray base color compon filter denois histogram equal carri enhanc imag effect suspici fire area obtain base color compon differ imag process threshold segment edg detect process flame imag pattern recognit technolog great signific extract flame imag comput vision theori key fire locat scheme system effect elimin interfer distanc light intens fire detect improv recognit accuraci,research fire detect imag inform process system base imag process paper base digit imag process technolog seri preprocess oper gray base color compon filter denois histogram equal carri enhanc imag effect suspici fire area obtain base color compon differ imag process threshold segment edg detect process flame imag pattern recognit technolog great signific extract flame imag comput vision theori key fire locat scheme system effect elimin interfer distanc light intens fire detect improv recognit accuraci,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686774514365559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966044480903998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25657298028723824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712676557090715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24549518782418242,0.0,0.08419648827864026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26250933220865486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754221876419301,0.0,0.11233170167405529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12485850113559907,0.0,0.14710533365314765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09277782251581948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274759391209121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12711509995790415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5528274625532907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0740101247709738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09118200798263781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686774514365559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12485850113559907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10111476425966048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811936735956408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05499035568974161,0.0,0.0,0.1295390020086709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32590836142197066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2542301999158083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06774112243570658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11889518055660446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13215701566685548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09714532856163244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795216372797987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14710533365314765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13215701566685548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13812033624585013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Design of High-Speed Image Processing System for Weak-Dim Target Based on FPGA,"A high-speed image processing system for weak-dim target is proposed which is implemented with FPGA. In order to achieve the parallel of image acquisition and processing, the capabilities of the CMV4000, such as exposing the next frame during the read-out of the previous one, windowing and 16 data- output channels, are sued. Besides this, the ping-pang memory structure is adopted. This design achieves long exposure time and high image frequency in a imaging system based on large-scale plane array detector. Experimental results show that the exposure time of image sensor is about 20ms and the image frequency is 50Hz. The system can meet high speed detection and tracking requirements for weak-dim targets. Currently, the system has been applied to the actual project.",Image Processing,design highspe imag process system weakdim target base fpga,highspe imag process system weakdim target propos implement fpga order achiev parallel imag acquisit process capabl cmv4000 expos next frame readout previou one window 16 data output channel su besid pingpang memori structur adopt design achiev long exposur time high imag frequenc imag system base largescal plane array detector experiment result show exposur time imag sensor 20m imag frequenc 50hz system meet high speed detect track requir weakdim target current system appli actual project,design highspe imag process system weakdim target base fpga highspe imag process system weakdim target propos implement fpga order achiev parallel imag acquisit process capabl cmv4000 expos next frame readout previou one window 16 data output channel su besid pingpang memori structur adopt design achiev long exposur time high imag frequenc imag system base largescal plane array detector experiment result show exposur time imag sensor 20m imag frequenc 50hz system meet high speed detect track requir weakdim target current system appli actual project,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19726656718306004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123813189534685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10129866660451763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13758065117605583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10732671540734316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10624732766882937,0.0,0.0,0.07389434365141537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671307416943472,0.0,0.0938425779795039,0.1660453453169647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12561242153675184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962538889338384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22402128124267146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5928789711289131,0.0,0.09167215379755844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13164047033957738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13632439555356993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994994346024508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11741783545249629,0.0,0.13892390562012585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13892390562012585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20971195581682062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10732671540734316,0.0,0.0,0.0695288230472697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08527679971536974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06915763086739107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09536791976052286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11741783545249629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2894328343719676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1819550608648489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Predicting CT Image From MRI Data Through Feature Matching With Learned Nonlinear Local Descriptors,"Attenuation correction for positron-emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) hybrid imaging systems and dose planning for MR-based radiation therapy remain challenging due to insufficient high-energy photon attenuation information. We present a novel approach that uses the learned nonlinear local descriptors and feature matching to predict pseudo computed tomography (pCT) images from T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The nonlinear local descriptors are obtained by projecting the linear descriptors into the nonlinear high-dimensional space using an explicit feature map and low-rank approximation with supervised manifold regularization. The nearest neighbors of each local descriptor in the input MR images are searched in a constrained spatial range of the MR images among the training dataset. Then the pCT patches are estimated through k-nearest neighbor regression. The proposed method for pCT prediction is quantitatively analyzed on a dataset consisting of paired brain MRI and CT images from 13 subjects. Our method generates pCT images with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 75.25 ± 18.05 Hounsfield units, a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 30.87 ± 1.15 dB, a relative MAE of 1.56 ± 0.5% in PET attenuation correction, and a dose relative structure volume difference of 0.055 ± 0.107% in D98%, as compared with true CT. The experimental results also show that our method outperforms four state-of-the-art methods.",Image Processing,predict ct imag mri data featur match learn nonlinear local descriptor,attenu correct positronemiss tomographi petmagnet reson mr hybrid imag system dose plan mrbase radiat therapi remain challeng due insuffici highenergi photon attenu inform present novel approach use learn nonlinear local descriptor featur match predict pseudo comput tomographi pct imag t1weight t2weight magnet reson imag mri data nonlinear local descriptor obtain project linear descriptor nonlinear highdimension space use explicit featur map lowrank approxim supervis manifold regular nearest neighbor local descriptor input mr imag search constrain spatial rang mr imag among train dataset pct patch estim knearest neighbor regress propos method pct predict quantit analyz dataset consist pair brain mri ct imag 13 subject method gener pct imag mean absolut error mae 7525 1805 hounsfield unit peak signaltonois ratio 3087 115 db rel mae 156 05 pet attenu correct dose rel structur volum differ 0055 0107 d98 compar true ct experiment result also show method outperform four stateoftheart method,predict ct imag mri data featur match learn nonlinear local descriptor attenu correct positronemiss tomographi petmagnet reson mr hybrid imag system dose plan mrbase radiat therapi remain challeng due insuffici highenergi photon attenu inform present novel approach use learn nonlinear local descriptor featur match predict pseudo comput tomographi pct imag t1weight t2weight magnet reson imag mri data nonlinear local descriptor obtain project linear descriptor nonlinear highdimension space use explicit featur map lowrank approxim supervis manifold regular nearest neighbor local descriptor input mr imag search constrain spatial rang mr imag among train dataset pct patch estim knearest neighbor regress propos method pct predict quantit analyz dataset consist pair brain mri ct imag 13 subject method gener pct imag mean absolut error mae 7525 1805 hounsfield unit peak signaltonois ratio 3087 115 db rel mae 156 05 pet attenu correct dose rel structur volum differ 0055 0107 d98 compar true ct experiment result also show method outperform four stateoftheart method,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05802612011989908,0.10213589268136782,0.0,0.0758941911979285,0.0,0.0,0.06570357175515604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061385627701077944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07960178816418384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676511562656449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09703340187836625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22195701131639464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11072507928304448,0.18552469039018285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060601080952154475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07805543838421175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10032273488016104,0.0,0.10847371940532599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941103516610344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26726805127568837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058736443478533115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5076481430078897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07326396144022565,0.0,0.0,0.10847371940532599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357372486318945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43389487762130396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847371940532599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22664239699413335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025755894222011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124484592583067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025755894222011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2865937738085248,0.05733449166823456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804104785660357,0.0,0.0,0.05209183858972033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025755894222011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408347719185669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05181373690077244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07145080363901886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408347719185669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08797086825110531,0.0,0.0,0.10213589268136782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043369318880659084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08487548715813865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10213589268136782,0.0,0.08032544304397875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Massive High-dimensional Image Processing System Based on Big Data Technology,"In order to overcome the difficulty of massive high-dimensional image processing, a massive high-dimensional image processing system based on big data technology is proposed in this paper. The system fully combines the big data technology, analyzes the differences between the current massive high-dimensional image processing work and the traditional image processing work, and discusses the difficulties of the current massive high-dimensional image processing work. Based on this, the system also includes parallel image processing model and low delay dynamic processing model, which greatly improves the accuracy and efficiency of static image processing and dynamic image processing.

Comprehensive Comparison of Image Quality Aspects Between Conventional and Plane-Wave Imaging Methods on a Commercial Scanner,"Coherent plane-wave compound imaging (CPWCI) is used as alternative for conventional focused imaging (CFI) to increase frame rates linearly with the ratio number of imaging lines to steering angles. In this study, the image quality was compared between CPWCI and CFI, and the effect of steering angles (range and number) and beamforming strategies was evaluated in CPWCI. In automated breast volume scanners (ABVSs), which suffer from reduced volume rates, CPWCI might be an excellent candidate to replace CFI. Therefore, the image quality of CFI currently in ABVS and CPWCI was also compared in an in vivo breast lesion. Images were obtained by a Siemens Sequoia ultrasound system, and two transducers (14L5 and 10L4) in a CIRS multipurpose phantom (040GSE) and a breast lesion. Phantom results showed that contrast sensitivity and resolution, axial resolution, and generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR; imaging depths <45 mm) were similar for most imaging sequences. CNR (imaging depths ≥45 mm), penetration, and lateral resolution were significantly improved for CPWCI (15 angles) compared to CFI for both transducers. In CPWCI, certain combinations of steering angles and beamforming methods yielded improved gCNR (small angles and delay-and-sum) or lateral resolution (large angles and Lu’s-fk). Image quality seemed similar between CPWCI and CFI (three angles incoherent compounded as in ABVS) by visual inspection of the in vivo breast lesion images.",Image Processing,comprehens comparison imag qualiti aspect convent planewav imag method commerci scanner,coher planewav compound imag cpwci use altern convent focus imag cfi increas frame rate linearli ratio number imag line steer angl studi imag qualiti compar cpwci cfi effect steer angl rang number beamform strategi evalu cpwci autom breast volum scanner abvss suffer reduc volum rate cpwci might excel candid replac cfi therefor imag qualiti cfi current abv cpwci also compar vivo breast lesion imag obtain siemen sequoia ultrasound system two transduc 14l5 10l4 cir multipurpos phantom 040gse breast lesion phantom result show contrast sensit resolut axial resolut gener contrasttonois ratio gcnr imag depth 45 mm similar imag sequenc cnr imag depth 45 mm penetr later resolut significantli improv cpwci 15 angl compar cfi transduc cpwci certain combin steer angl beamform method yield improv gcnr small angl delayandsum later resolut larg angl lusfk imag qualiti seem similar cpwci cfi three angl incoher compound abv visual inspect vivo breast lesion imag,comprehens comparison imag qualiti aspect convent planewav imag method commerci scanner coher planewav compound imag cpwci use altern convent focus imag cfi increas frame rate linearli ratio number imag line steer angl studi imag qualiti compar cpwci cfi effect steer angl rang number beamform strategi evalu cpwci autom breast volum scanner abvss suffer reduc volum rate cpwci might excel candid replac cfi therefor imag qualiti cfi current abv cpwci also compar vivo breast lesion imag obtain siemen sequoia ultrasound system two transduc 14l5 10l4 cir multipurpos phantom 040gse breast lesion phantom result show contrast sensit resolut axial resolut gener contrasttonois ratio gcnr imag depth 45 mm similar imag sequenc cnr imag depth 45 mm penetr later resolut significantli improv cpwci 15 angl compar cfi transduc cpwci certain combin steer angl beamform method yield improv gcnr small angl delayandsum later resolut larg angl lusfk imag qualiti seem similar cpwci cfi three angl incoher compound abv visual inspect vivo breast lesion imag,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054712932905279114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945944869488183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09007659473042057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08096444720461976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22517000719510485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825851028690944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1859904702476941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07505666906503496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05572449387824164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06426957311627472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09149296895212215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055382698076234756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7778263123063318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11214214039178812,0.0,0.0,0.06426957311627472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0743169185260327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10228006490088237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10685076164500604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16005849864132518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660591118025356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28624307689934236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510401447479292,0.0,0.1859904702476941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07505666906503496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04885526560738588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737109111297085,0.0,0.0,0.09149296895212215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08002924932066259,0.0,0.0,0.053113681080307874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04089300868578015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08193632874112654,0.0,0.0862567712871656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660591118025356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037869502275621664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Application of Image Processing and Industrial Robot Arm for Quality Assurance Process of Production,"Recently, in the new era of highly developed technology, image processing is becoming a more efficient and required sector in the industry, enterprise, monitoring, and other various systems. All these applications lead us to research the image processing techniques in the quality assurance process of production with an ABB IRB 120 industrial robot arm. There are numerous types of image processing methods that are used in the quality assurance process of products. Hence, in our experiment, we attempted to distinguish the normal and abnormal products, which are replaced by 3D objects using the image processing system and ABB industrial robot arm. Therefore, we used the OpenCV library to enhance our image processing system. This paper presents the combination work of image processing methods and usages with modeling the end-effector of ABB IRB 120 industrial robot, their programming and experimental results.",Image Processing,applic imag process industri robot arm qualiti assur process product,recent new era highli develop technolog imag process becom effici requir sector industri enterpris monitor variou system applic lead us research imag process techniqu qualiti assur process product abb irb 120 industri robot arm numer type imag process method use qualiti assur process product henc experi attempt distinguish normal abnorm product replac 3d object use imag process system abb industri robot arm therefor use opencv librari enhanc imag process system paper present combin work imag process method usag model endeffector abb irb 120 industri robot program experiment result,applic imag process industri robot arm qualiti assur process product recent new era highli develop technolog imag process becom effici requir sector industri enterpris monitor variou system applic lead us research imag process techniqu qualiti assur process product abb irb 120 industri robot arm numer type imag process method use qualiti assur process product henc experi attempt distinguish normal abnorm product replac 3d object use imag process system abb industri robot arm therefor use opencv librari enhanc imag process system paper present combin work imag process method usag model endeffector abb irb 120 industri robot program experiment result,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11970154012384378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08642218698349645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08642218698349645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050010001591352084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07076232578424528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07502789840475835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756975591540072,0.09471848799031225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4470624721628528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3854499786791923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09084079871994828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11405347434629089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058050743250204415,0.0,0.0,0.0961485760898872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06709007589034402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279588965052674,0.0920712618210375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04446979577719632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05770498425155543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5271134580865928,0.0,0.33054857178129204,0.0,0.08542394826039794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22915384686077503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08011617089045904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06430327057526909,0.054781131030143336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05214855464620491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13094870767271488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07311500340019726,0.059480831349779356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745958217081275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09926395937881179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126675298719185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756975591540072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06758448629924453,0.0
A Simple Measure for Acuity in Medical Images,"An automatic and objective assessment of image quality is important in an era, where large-scale processing of imaging data from multi-center studies becomes commonplace. Based on a comprehensive statistical image model that includes noise and blur, a measure for image acuity is derived here as the ratio of the maximal gradient magnitude and the intensity difference at a boundary. Acuity may be affected by the object under study, the image acquisition, reconstruction processes, and any post-processing steps. The acuity measure presented here is post-hoc, intuitive to understand, simple to compute, and easily integrates with other standard measures of image quality.

Open source image processing module to improve dental patient care in suburban and rural areas: Review Paper,"The study paper showcases a detailed study of dental imaging can be possible only under the technology of open-source image processing modules as it involves the use of the latest image processing tools and devices for improving both the quality and accuracy of dental images. Dental radiography delivers significant indications for medical diagnosis, treatment and superiority valuation. Many determinations have been prepared to mature numeral X-ray image investigation organizations to progress medical eminence. This paper has presented records, techniques, and consequences for assessing the superiority of dental caution-consuming circumferential dental radiographs occupied earlier and afterwards the technique. Dental experimental eminence assessment comprises many procedures, such as statistics of yearly dental appointments of kids and grownups of dissimilar eternities, different caries between kids with vigorous caries, endodontics to abstraction events etc. This eminence extent evaluates dental scientific superiority. At the macro level, It is needed to escalate the micro level equally well, such as thoughtful whether the treatment assumed to distinct teeth is operative or not. The original and developing ground in orthodonture is dental informatics, owing to its possibility to recover treatment and analysis, while exchangeable time and plummeting nervousness and exhaustion throughout the regular repetition. The usage of computer curriculums can comfort dental specialists in the creation of conclusions associated with deterrence, identification, as well as cure schedule, surrounded by others. This study paper will also discuss the efficiency of Image processing tools that help a dentist and dental professionals improve the treatment quality.",Image Processing,open sourc imag process modul

Diverse Image Processing Techniques for Machine Learning Methods,"Machine learning is a trending topic in the area of computer vision, which makes the machine able to learn about it without being expressly programmed using various algorithms. When a model is designed to predict future-based on historical data using machine learning algorithms, data is vital because high quality data is needed to run the model efficiently and to predict highly accurate results. Machine learning algorithms receive data in many forms, like audio (speech recognition), images (feature recognition), numeric data (like height and weight) etc. When it comes to computer vision, the machine learning algorithms must be able to understand the image data, and before the images are processed to the algorithms it should be pre-processed (cleaned and set to the desired format) using various image pre-processing techniques. This research paper presents various image processing techniques, literature reviews on various image processing techniques and image PSNR value after applying median filter, grayscale filter and box filters.",Image Processing,divers imag process techniqu machin learn method,machin learn trend topic area comput vision make machin abl learn without expressli program use variou algorithm model design predict futurebas histor data use machin learn algorithm data vital high qualiti data need run model effici predict highli accur result machin learn algorithm receiv data mani form like audio speech recognit imag featur recognit numer data like height weight etc come comput vision machin learn algorithm must abl understand imag data imag process algorithm preprocess clean set desir format use variou imag preprocess techniqu research paper present variou imag process techniqu literatur review variou imag process techniqu imag psnr valu appli median filter grayscal filter box filter,divers imag process techniqu machin learn method machin learn trend topic area comput vision make machin abl learn without expressli program use variou algorithm model design predict futurebas histor data use machin learn algorithm data vital high qualiti data need run model effici predict highli accur result machin learn algorithm receiv data mani form like audio speech recognit imag featur recognit numer data like height weight etc come comput vision machin learn algorithm must abl understand imag data imag process algorithm preprocess clean set desir format use variou imag preprocess techniqu research paper present variou imag process techniqu literatur review variou imag process techniqu imag psnr valu appli median filter grayscal filter box filter,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29316452569713064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061768608148711844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058632905139426136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11011956768290715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2703500989937199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05095542537408539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775078361430866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05722212958153985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08471124622242053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07250785718616991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165046100904902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06830041895849512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41316362593678235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30172178666393445,0.0,0.0,0.14319509843206008,0.0,0.0,0.06830041895849512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4193130901916223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414761424421797,0.0,0.06233901552199456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04611481191395026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09388575391645673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07659433933919532,0.0,0.05589867602282244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08312615014897859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03596061022903646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15550156722861733,0.04666327808968636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17050064009919844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06907828682210379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061768608148711844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16625230029795718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04429889695807726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04217005756076388,0.06682472981856555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06612338800748795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23649851259424295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828436752039308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06754985040792999,0.0,0.0,0.09806265942308282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802700460082349,0.24485207295892875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18064591560250778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07659433933919532,0.0,0.0
Cross-Modality Image Adaptation Based on Volumetric Intensity Gaussian Process Models (VIGPM),"Image-based diagnosis routinely depends on more that one image modality for exploiting the complementary information they provide. However, it is not always possible to obtain images from a secondary modality for several reasons such as cost, degree of invasiveness and non-availability of scanners. Three-dimensional (3D) morphable models have made a significant contribution to the field of medical imaging for feature-based analysis. Here we extend their use to encode 3D volumetric imaging modalities. Specifically, we build a Gaussian Process (GP) over transformations establishing anatomical correspondence between training images within a modality. Given, two different modalities, the GP's eigenspace (latent space) can then be used to provide a parametric representation of each image modality, and we provide an operator for cross-domain translation between the two. We show that the latent space yields samples that are representative of the encoded modality. We also demonstrate that a 3D volumetric image can be efficiently encoded in latent space and transferred to synthesize the corresponding image in another modality. The framework called VIGPM can be extended by designing a fitting process to learn an observation in a given modality and performing cross-modality synthesis. Clinical Relevance— The proposed method provides a way to access a multi modality image from one modality.

Flexible Prediction of CT Images From MRI Data Through Improved Neighborhood Anchored Regression for PET Attenuation Correction,"Given the complicated relationship between the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals and the attenuation values, the attenuation correction in hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI systems remains a challenging task. Currently, existing methods are either time-consuming or require sufficient samples to train the models. In this paper, an efficient approach for predicting pseudo computed tomography (CT) images from T1- and T2-weighted MRI data with limited data is proposed. The proposed approach uses improved neighborhood anchored regression (INAR) as a baseline method to pre-calculate projected matrices to flexibly predict the pseudo CT patches. Techniques, including the augmentation of the MR/CT dataset, learning of the nonlinear descriptors of MR images, hierarchical search for nearest neighbors, data-driven optimization, and multi-regressor ensemble, are adopted to improve the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In total, 22 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. The pseudo CT images obtained using INAR with multi-regressor ensemble yielded mean absolute error (MAE) of 92.73 ± 14.86 HU, peak signal-to-noise ratio of 29.77 ± 1.63 dB, Pearson linear correlation coefficient of 0.82 ± 0.05, dice similarity coefficient of 0.81 ± 0.03, and the relative mean absolute error (rMAE) in PET attenuation correction of 1.30 ± 0.20% compared with true CT images. Moreover, our proposed INAR method, without any refinement strategies, can achieve considerable results with only seven subjects (MAE 106.89 ± 14.43 HU, rMAE 1.51 ± 0.21%). The experiments prove the superior performance of the proposed method over the six innovative methods. Moreover, the proposed method can rapidly generate the pseudo CT images that are suitable for PET attenuation correction.",Image Processing,flexibl predict ct imag mri data improv neighborhood anchor

Review on Digital Image Processing Techniques for Face Recognition,"In the world of advancement, security is an important aspect of everyone's life. Personal data is easily accessed by hackers. This kind of problem can be reduced by using biometric access. Fingerprint, voice recognition, iris recognition, face recognition, and dental data is the few biometric techniques that provide end to end security between the user and service provider. Digital image processing plays a major role in this biometric recognition technique. Advancement in the digital image processing technique with the intellectual computer allows the researcher to work on this recognition technique. All recognition techniques have its merit and demerits. Face recognition is the most preferred technique which is not only providing secure access and also helpful to limit unauthorized access. Nowadays, social sites are using this technique to identify the user. If one photo is uploaded on the website immediately it matches the images with the database and helps the user to tag their friends.

Enumeration of Ampicillin-Resistant E. Coli in Blood Using Droplet Microfluidics and High-Speed Image Processing,"Bacteria entering the bloodstream causes bloodstream infection (BSI). Without proper treatment, BSI can lead to sepsis which is a life-threatening condition. Detection of bacteria in blood at the early stages of BSI can effectively prevent the development of sepsis. Using microfluidic droplets for single bacterium encapsulation provides single-digit bacterial detection sensitivity. In this study, samples of ampicillin-resistant E. coli in human blood were partitioned into millions of 30 μm diameter microfluidic droplets and followed by 8-hour culturing. Thousands of fluorescent bacteria from a single colony filled up the positive droplets after the culturing process. A circle detection software based on Hough Transform was developed to count the number of positive droplets from fluorescence images. The period to process one image can be as short as 0.5 ms when the original image is pre-processed and binarized by the developed software.",Image Processing,enumer ampicillinresist e coli blood use droplet microfluid highspe imag process,bacteria enter bloodstream caus bloodstream infect bsi without proper treatment bsi lead sepsi lifethreaten condit detect bacteria blood earli stage bsi effect prevent develop sepsi use microfluid droplet singl bacterium encapsul provid singledigit bacteri detect sensit studi sampl ampicillinresist e coli human blood partit million 30 μm diamet microfluid droplet follow 8hour cultur thousand fluoresc bacteria singl coloni fill posit droplet cultur process circl detect softwar base hough transform develop count number posit droplet fluoresc imag period process one imag short 05 ms origin imag preprocess binar develop softwar,enumer ampicillinresist e coli blood use droplet microfluid highspe imag process bacteria enter bloodstream caus bloodstream infect bsi without proper treatment bsi lead sepsi lifethreaten condit detect bacteria blood earli stage bsi effect prevent develop sepsi use microfluid droplet singl bacterium encapsul provid singledigit bacteri detect sensit studi sampl ampicillinresist e coli human blood partit million 30 μm diamet microfluid droplet follow 8hour cultur thousand fluoresc bacteria singl coloni fill posit droplet cultur process circl detect softwar base hough transform develop count number posit droplet fluoresc imag period process one imag short 05 ms origin imag preprocess binar develop softwar,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.081052549910374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14386701859552645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36750771331651133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3317114799377689,0.0,0.0,0.23443112497654756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09294246326838981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264582466053069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39917865931178204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14194434419806246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13348018165288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11723571331042942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3102121032635626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24709417523971183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09530482315563137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577734316949196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3339919299795942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19183426267248152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1705921492245368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08858790828395506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15023807332133857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12632451474336237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14800347256595087,0.0,0.0
What Makes Research Software Sustainable? An Interview Study with Research Software Engineers,"Software is now a vital scientific instrument, providing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the humanities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent 'reinvention of the wheel'. Understanding how to develop sustainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers - the people actively developing software in an academic research environment - subjectively define software sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.",Software Engineering,make research softwar sustain interview studi research softwar engin,softwar vital scientif instrument provid tool data collect analysi across disciplin bioinformat comput physic human softwar use research often homegrown bespok construct particular project rare maintain beyond lead rapid decay frequent reinvent wheel understand develop sustain research softwar suitabl futur reus therefor interest research funder achiev remain open question report result interview studi examin research softwar engin peopl activ develop softwar academ research environ subject defin softwar sustain themat analysi data reveal two interact dimens intrins sustain relat intern qualiti softwar modular encapsul testabl extrins sustain concern cultur organis factor includ softwar resourc support share research softwar engin believ increas focu qualiti discover key factor increas sustain academ research softwar,make research softwar sustain interview studi research softwar engin softwar vital scientif instrument provid tool data collect analysi across disciplin bioinformat comput physic human softwar use research often homegrown bespok construct particular project rare maintain beyond lead rapid decay frequent reinvent wheel understand develop sustain research softwar suitabl futur reus therefor interest research funder achiev remain open question report result interview studi examin research softwar engin peopl activ develop softwar academ research environ subject defin softwar sustain themat analysi data reveal two interact dimens intrins sustain relat intern qualiti softwar modular encapsul testabl extrins sustain concern cultur organis factor includ softwar resourc support share research softwar engin believ increas focu qualiti discover key factor increas sustain academ research softwar,0.0,0.1815474218340442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06444757748184948,0.07160712393171127,0.07488695800956416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712725086570644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08462517019071282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05900020510210621,0.0,0.08331511422752773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207590759320248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10190142364569912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656601229392632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907737109170221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08666980135425177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10190142364569912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17190500902630235,0.0,0.0,0.07488695800956416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08907517549034999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16415181518640495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06680038396540067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012791783078323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05900020510210621,0.0,0.11889052514833835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0797820207812643,0.08749387683916922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07488695800956416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07871579413507698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907737109170221,0.0,0.06873841728325487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08462517019071282,0.0,0.0,0.07769697131061806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09678703154825492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012791783078323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052851664375796935,0.0,0.13237830937148906,0.0,0.0,0.0907737109170221,0.0,0.0,0.08462517019071282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07488695800956416,0.0,0.0907737109170221,0.08749387683916922,0.0,0.0,0.427222818829934,0.0,0.06807403048544786,0.0,0.04518800968084239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08749387683916922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6382946674160248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825354565176218,0.08907517549034999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06335595499967284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578588654335278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06807403048544786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085558972991685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07238413866935456,0.0,0.0,0.035026878150484775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Software Engineering Education: Towards Ethical, Reliable, and Beautiful Software","In this paper, we present our experience with an innovative pedagogical approach to software engineering in a graduate-level advanced software engineering course. Our approach to software engineering and software design education relies on six dimensions: 1) restating the goal of software engineering education to say that software must be conceived of, architected, designed, developed, deployed, maintained, and managed to be ethical, reliable, and beautiful; 2) software should be engineered as a service; 3) apply proven architectural principles; 4) use sound design principles; 5) create rapid multi-modal prototyping; and 6) bring the course learning objectives together by creating a term-long project that creates a solution to a real-world problem using an iterative process. The results from students’ feedback have been very positive with students citing the benefits of the course particularly a) the realignment of software engineering education goals centered on creating ethical, reliable, and beautiful software, b) the focus on clean, sound, and efficient architectures, and c) blending of IEEE SWEBOK, modern microservice architectures, and emerging approaches from software engineering research and open source. We plan to continue developing the course and enhance it in the areas of software reuse, software product design, AI and software design, design for diverse users, and design for sustainability.CCS

Tutorial on a Gamification Toolset for Improving Engagement of Students in Software Engineering Courses,"Few if any would dispute that educating software engineering is a challenging endeavour. Although programming and creating new artefacts can motivate the creativity of students. Other software engineering topics (like e.g. requirement specifications and testing) are not considered very exciting by students. However, these topics are important to develop quality software and insufficient knowledge of students — Europe's future software engineers — in the long run contributes to failing software. The EU Erasmus+ project IMPRESS was set to explore the use of gamification in educating software engineering at the university level. The objective has been to develop a toolset that can help to improve students' engagement, and hence their appreciation, for the taught subjects like software testing and specifications. The proposed tutorial will guide participants through the set of tools developed by the project and introduce how they can use them to improve students' engagement.",Software Engineering,tutori gamif toolset improv engag student softwar engin cours,would disput educ softwar engin challeng endeavour although program creat new artefact motiv creativ student softwar engin topic like eg requir specif test consid excit student howev topic import develop qualiti softwar insuffici knowledg student europ futur softwar engin long run contribut fail softwar eu erasmu project impress set explor use gamif educ softwar engin univers level object develop toolset help improv student engag henc appreci taught subject like softwar test specif propos tutori guid particip set tool develop project introduc use improv student engag,tutori gamif toolset improv engag student softwar engin cours would disput educ softwar engin challeng endeavour although program creat new artefact motiv creativ student softwar engin topic like eg requir specif test consid excit student howev topic import develop qualiti softwar insuffici knowledg student europ futur softwar engin long run contribut fail softwar eu erasmu project impress set explor use gamif educ softwar engin univers level object develop toolset help improv student engag henc appreci taught subject like softwar test specif propos tutori guid particip set tool develop project introduc use improv student engag,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06020397412871144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07730003489037245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139984401435608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983915545289884,0.08971915900540393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1461972562086625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704505836920422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10638563522595815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322193995748771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139984401435608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07512061253807267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139984401435608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06020397412871144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07007539866996579,0.17496536865820908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07655289632243664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09097669991156278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230430438797831,0.0,0.17255491471261192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06537615611470898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08971915900540393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936923119737316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832416613529331,0.1577252054777607,0.0,0.0,0.0510890874659487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0744332524487541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06266054405254017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15936181759118723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4785310457787432,0.0,0.0,0.15024122507614535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4994499681175986,0.0,0.10016980962620242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15024122507614535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07655289632243664,0.2127712704519163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10207990376181868,0.07877920412324889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"A Progression Model of Software Engineering Goals, Challenges, and Practices in Start-Ups","Context: Software start-ups are emerging as suppliers of innovation and software-intensive products. However, traditional software engineering practices are not evaluated in the context, nor adopted to goals and challenges of start-ups. As a result, there is insufficient support for software engineering in the start-up context. Objective: We aim to collect data related to engineering goals, challenges, and practices in start-up companies to ascertain trends and patterns characterizing engineering work in start-ups. Such data allows researchers to understand better how goals and challenges are related to practices. This understanding can then inform future studies aimed at designing solutions addressing those goals and challenges. Besides, these trends and patterns can be useful for practitioners to make more informed decisions in their engineering practice. Method: We use a case survey method to gather first-hand, in-depth experiences from a large sample of software start-ups. We use open coding and cross-case analysis to describe and identify patterns, and corroborate the findings with statistical analysis. Results: We analyze 84 start-up cases and identify 16 goals, 9 challenges, and 16 engineering practices that are common among start-ups. We have mapped these goals, challenges, and practices to start-up life-cycle stages (inception, stabilization, growth, and maturity). Thus, creating the progression model guiding software engineering efforts in start-ups. Conclusions: We conclude that start-ups to a large extent face the same challenges and use the same practices as established companies. However, the primary software engineering challenge in start-ups is to evolve multiple process areas at once, with a little margin for serious errors.",Software Engineering,progress model softwar

Developing an Optimizing Compiler for the Game Boy as a Software Engineering Project,"Software engineering students not only have to learn theoretical concepts but also how to successfully apply them in practice. Hence, projects are an important part of software engineering curricula. As software engineering methods and technologies are only relevant for non-trivial software systems, we report in this paper on a master-level software engineering project course in which a team of students developed a compiler for the Game Boy in a single semester. The students developed different languages and corresponding parsers to a common intermediate language, optimizations on the intermediate language, as well as a code generator for the Game Boy. We particularly present lessons learned by us and the students as well as potential course improvements.",Software Engineering,develop optim compil game boy softwar engin project,softwar engin student learn theoret concept also success appli practic henc project import part softwar engin curricula softwar engin method technolog relev nontrivi softwar system report paper masterlevel softwar engin project cours team student develop compil game boy singl semest student develop differ languag correspond parser common intermedi languag optim intermedi languag well code gener game boy particularli present lesson learn us student well potenti cours improv,develop optim compil game boy softwar engin project softwar engin student learn theoret concept also success appli practic henc project import part softwar engin curricula softwar engin method technolog relev nontrivi softwar system report paper masterlevel softwar engin project cours team student develop compil game boy singl semest student develop differ languag correspond parser common intermedi languag optim intermedi languag well code gener game boy particularli present lesson learn us student well potenti cours improv,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061273313318721406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08014129751795836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10593688419286681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10593688419286681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09659943074318048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21187376838573363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15740865030980816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06399237124525876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34690200981852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40927354301826696,0.06202338700314588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544925404631132,0.06279429871136628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29386022516620297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13048902021810468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05983137668705347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15606521962115236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046656870693186386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08242349001559057,0.0,0.07143697503250976,0.0,0.0,0.06054298072485823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547309610105433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10593688419286681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11212934911632425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3864210314241341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.358500779095605,0.0,0.0,0.09937685049330236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04579630446949114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11212934911632425,0.0,0.0,0.062406165994424764,0.0,0.0,0.10593688419286681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16645584844120553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Why Pakistani Software Companies don't use Best Practices for Requirement Engineering Processes,"Requirement engineering (RE) is initial and critical phase of software engineering. The success of software project is based on good requirement engineering practices. The purpose of requirement engineering practices is to elicit all intended user needs and document them for clarity of understanding and for future reference. In developing countries like Pakistan best RE practices are not fully used in software industry. In this study, major reasons for not using best RE practices are identified based on literature review of research work done related to RE in different countries. Literature review revealed that lack of knowledge of requirement engineering processes, lack of cost, lack of time are major factors behind not using RE practices in software development. A survey was conducted to base on factors identified to highlight major obstacles in way of using best requirement engineering practices in Pakistan.

Poster: A Matrix for Analyzing Projects in Software Engineering Courses,"The careful selection of a project for Software Engineering courses is important from the point of view of the student, the teacher and the project user or client -if available. But, how do you determine whether to develop a complex fictional case, or a simple real-world project with a considerable amount of learning about the software lifecycle? How do you determine whether or not to develop a social project aimed at the community? In order to analyze project characteristics a framework was elaborated, based in a matrix with attributes found in different academic projects carried out over 10 years, and weighted according to certain criteria. It is expected that the result of this analysis will help professors choose the most appropriate software project to develop in class, depending on the characteristics of each project.",Software Engineering,poster matrix analyz project softwar engin cours,care select project softwar engin cours import point view student teacher project user client avail determin whether develop complex fiction case simpl realworld project consider amount learn softwar lifecycl determin whether develop social project aim commun order analyz project characterist framework elabor base matrix attribut found differ academ project carri 10 year weight accord certain criteria expect result analysi help professor choos appropri softwar project develop class depend characterist project,poster matrix analyz project softwar engin cours care select project softwar engin cours import point view student teacher project user client avail determin whether develop complex fiction case simpl realworld project consider amount learn softwar lifecycl determin whether develop social project aim commun order analyz project characterist framework elabor base matrix attribut found differ academ project carri 10 year weight accord certain criteria expect result analysi help professor choos appropri softwar project develop class depend characterist project,0.0,0.10643342846441052,0.0,0.10444187224176994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0776076970875931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06866665882836862,0.1552153941751862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643342846441052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885999759773273,0.05270216212850413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09623513406274724,0.0899570360788124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18709104025351608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0749180831516039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08222595121867017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008533881938243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20517555551184155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18971338579155705,0.15243230682000158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061969305680457415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13437399658292332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643342846441052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08059674265561156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08487140128120542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07306398866575473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06318185921605644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899570360788124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008533881938243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7400335609680314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643342846441052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05298356481439317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09623513406274724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2494697680540996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679176882394275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11948082516897846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08487140128120542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885999759773273
The Impact of Combining Storytelling with Lecture on Female Students in Software Engineering Education,"Software engineering courses are characterized by heavy theoretical and complex concepts that might be challenging to teach while keeping students engaged in the classroom, which might impact them from pursuing software engineering careers later. Software engineering is well known to be a male dominated field even though the first software engineer was a woman. Research has shown that storytelling can be used to improve students and teachers engagement in primary and secondary education. However, there is a lack of research on storytelling application and efficiency in higher education to teach complex concepts. This study explored the impact of combining a story with lecture on undergraduate female students in a software engineering course. We investigated the following hypothesis: Combining storytelling with lectures can improve the female students interest in software engineering. A questionnaire study has been conducted with 24 female undergraduate students in the classroom. Students had no prior knowledge on software engineering before the study. The questionnaire was designed to be simple to motivate students to participate in the study. It contained three questions to capture the interest of female students in pursuing a career in software engineering: prior to the lecture, after the lecture, and after the story. The results showed that the story incorporated in the lecture had great impact on female students perception about software engineering. Combining storytelling with software engineering lectures seems a promising tool to engage female students in higher education and increase their interest in pursuing a career in software engineering.",Software Engineering,impact combin storytel lectur femal student softwar engin educ,softwar engin cours character heavi theoret complex concept might challeng teach keep student engag

An Agile Software Engineering Course with Product Hand-Off,"This paper describes a novel design for an agile software engineering course that emphasizes keeping product artifacts updated throughout development. The signature transformative event in the course is the mid-semester project ""hand-off,"" at which point teams trade projects with other student teams and must make immediate progress despite no prior knowledge of the new project's design, coding conventions, or documentation. Course features are described along with their implementation and assessment.",Software Engineering,agil softwar engin cours product handoff,paper describ novel design agil softwar engin cours emphas keep product artifact updat throughout develop signatur transform event cours midsemest project handoff point team trade project student team must make immedi progress despit prior knowledg new project design code convent document cours featur describ along implement assess,agil softwar engin cours product handoff paper describ novel design agil softwar engin cours emphas keep product artifact updat throughout develop signatur transform event cours midsemest project handoff point team trade project student team must make immedi progress despit prior knowledg new project design code convent document cours featur describ along implement assess,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30022856577639145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13479036713774056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609655839582654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323975138587688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301591491031689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5295900554350752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27472125097942846,0.16525005624640024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0655752530375887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14315449818462717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17342010387605808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13736062548971423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11757263716626953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09064058722948609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12241994696625537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10401637101552379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12419893260664473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08797137698114185,0.0,0.11911434058477141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058310698216890444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301591491031689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21671471251782604,0.0,0.0,0.3183569745099394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16098007869841122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201153458099763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2802734319913646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12607412528833997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Large Language Models for Software Engineering: Survey and Open Problems,"This paper provides a survey of the emerging area of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Software Engineering (SE). It also sets out open research challenges for the application of LLMs to technical problems faced by software engineers. LLMs' emergent properties bring novelty and creativity with applications right across the spectrum of Software Engineering activities including coding, design, requirements, repair, refactoring, performance improvement, documentation and analytics. However, these very same emergent properties also pose significant technical challenges; we need techniques that can reliably weed out incorrect solutions, such as hallucinations. Our survey reveals the pivotal role that hybrid techniques (traditional SE plus LLMs) have to play in the development and deployment of reliable, efficient and effective LLM-based SE.",Software Engineering,larg languag model softwar engin survey open problem,paper provid survey emerg area larg languag model llm softwar engin se also set open research challeng applic llm technic problem face softwar engin llm emerg properti bring novelti creativ applic right across spectrum softwar engin activ includ code design requir repair refactor perform improv document analyt howev emerg properti also pose signific technic challeng need techniqu reliabl weed incorrect solut hallucin survey reveal pivot role hybrid techniqu tradit se plu llm play develop deploy reliabl effici effect llmbase se,larg languag model softwar engin survey open problem paper provid survey emerg area larg languag model llm softwar engin se also set open research challeng applic llm technic problem face softwar engin llm emerg properti bring novelti creativ applic right across spectrum softwar engin activ includ code design requir repair refactor perform improv document analyt howev emerg properti also pose signific technic challeng need techniqu reliabl weed incorrect solut hallucin survey reveal pivot role hybrid techniqu tradit se plu llm play develop deploy reliabl effici effect llmbase se,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313457282340957,0.0869424007324594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11750524834380684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12042207716552214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07294337792904107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12430838754773145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10157880496115203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09020477523634254,0.0,0.06339206358201849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050311034130813836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10983184220452596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05983887304425546,0.07118827583325978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24678616571578715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2661047990185069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09020477523634254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062154193773865725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06021103858276107,0.06849816859471694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18784751395716984,0.15960811281431675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43932736881810386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11680035321115387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06954180832707876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804095504726851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044737479343006675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06652619975462673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10983184220452596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14711023053348563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06135982426941592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16626914564681913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0646903406856671,0.05511088312900035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09824828854490082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549171168902732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226205523859573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790327153786055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24701617938506024,0.08226205523859573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2672168680115198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1905772817621237,0.14711023053348563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09672733731974037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Are Computer Science and Engineering Graduates Ready for the Software Industry? Experiences from an Industrial Student Training Program,"It has been 50 years since the term ""software engineering"" was coined in 1968 at a NATO conference. The field should be relatively mature by now, with most established universities covering core software engineering topics in their Computer Science programs and others offering specialized degrees. However, still many practitioners lament a lack of skills in new software engineering hires. With the growing demand for software engineers from the industry, this apparent gap becomes more and more pronounced. One corporate strategy to address this gap is for the industry to develop supplementary training programs before the hiring process, which could also help companies screen viable candidates. In this paper, we report on our experiences and lessons learned in conducting a summer school program aimed at screening new graduates, introducing them to core skills relevant to the organization and industry, and assessing their attitudes toward mastering those skills before the hiring process begins. Our experience suggests that such initiatives can be mutually beneficial for new hires and companies alike. We support this insight with pre- and post-training data collected from the participants during the first edition of the summer school and a follow-up questionnaire conducted after a year with the participants, 50% of whom were hired by the company shortly after the summer school.",Software Engineering,comput scienc engin graduat readi softwar industri experi industri student train program,50 year sinc term softwar engin coin 1968 nato confer field rel matur establish univers cover core softwar engin topic comput scienc program other offer special degre howev still mani practition lament lack skill new softwar engin hire grow demand softwar engin industri appar gap becom pronounc one corpor strategi address gap industri develop supplementari train program hire process could also help compani screen viabl candid paper report experi lesson learn conduct summer school program aim screen new graduat introduc core skill relev organ industri assess attitud toward master skill hire process begin experi suggest initi mutual benefici new hire compani alik support insight pre posttrain data collect particip first edit summer school followup questionnair conduct year particip 50 hire compani shortli summer school,comput scienc engin graduat readi softwar industri experi industri student train program 50 year sinc term softwar engin coin 1968 nato confer field rel matur establish univers cover core softwar engin topic comput scienc program other offer special degre howev still mani practition lament lack skill new softwar engin hire grow demand softwar engin industri appar gap becom pronounc one corpor strategi address gap industri develop supplementari train program hire process could also help compani screen viabl candid paper report experi lesson learn conduct summer school program aim screen new graduat introduc core skill relev organ industri assess attitud toward master skill hire process begin experi suggest initi mutual benefici new hire compani alik support insight pre posttrain data collect particip first edit summer school followup questionnair conduct year particip 50 hire compani shortli summer school,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07262723168818434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06784411915743266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05187130853520954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863982702504511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07675939852473698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674110067420567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26449603104431585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12095084048935181,0.0,0.0,0.1483879995841521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17348220134841133,0.0,0.0,0.08968153520021893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04949025316709671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09492380530510618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04441842744741448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2936720769314557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863982702504511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20170164560503037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06784411915743266,0.0,0.0,0.07675939852473698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419399979207605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054874474245920984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3423531567239502,0.0,0.0,0.08816534368143863,0.0,0.08968153520021893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06977612356146495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09492380530510618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05523315013978866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06847063134479005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17876638113677423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412809743749373,0.0,0.06663909529649031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09130237194641327,0.0,0.03949766715608955,0.0,0.17079657729742534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09130237194641327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936354735034595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3034910879692766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968153520021893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2224155671703345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27913013041439416,0.0,0.0,0.27260596089677647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674110067420567,0.0,0.07587277199231915,0.0,0.07587277199231915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08539828864871267,0.0,0.06494007939425303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09696794746243663,0.0,0.0750183936663522,0.0,0.0,0.1517455439846383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09304337680479806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15536160694332826
Should Robotics Engineering Education Include Software Engineering Education?,"Multiple universities across the United States now offer bachelor's degrees in robotics, which aim to prepare students to work in the robotics industry. To judge how well these programs are providing software engineering training, we evaluate whether these programs teach the software engineering practices that are required for robotics software engineering. We compile an updated list of robotics bachelor's degree programs and measure whether the curriculum of each program claims to teach a specific practice. We find that some of these practices are not mentioned in the curricula, and that some are only taught implicitly in long-term project courses. These project courses vary in scope, guidance, and structure.

Value Based Prioritization of Requirements in Software Engineering Education,"Both physical and software products have a functional use for which they were designed. Putting a new project idea into action necessitates a clear, holistic vision of the expected gain and costs. However, gain (or value) can have many different manifestations that often go far beyond pure functionality. For one thing, it can be about purely monetary value, but it can also be about expanding the company’s reach, improving customer loyalty, displacing competitors, or generating other additional benefits for the company or the user. Cost and Value Engineering is a promising approach for addressing such a value-centered perspective without losing sight of expenses. In typical Software Engineering courses Software Engineering students learn how to deal with requirements in general, as well as user stories, epics, and other requirements artifacts in the context of agile software development projects. However, aside from rudimentary planning activities for user stories or epics, they rarely learn to apply good value prioritization techniques. The primary goal of this paper is to present a validation experiment for two cost and value engineering methods in order to determine whether these methods are appropriate and valuable in a student context. The results are promising, indicating that these methods should be used in software engineering courses on a regular basis. In order for these methodologies to be properly incorporated into Software Engineering courses, an integrated tool support is required.",Software Engineering,valu base priorit requir softwar engin

Is Software Engineering Research Addressing Software Engineering Problems? (Keynote),"Brian Randell described software engineering as “the multi-person development of multi-version programs”. David Parnas expressed that this “pithy phrase implies everything that differentiates software engineering from other programming” (Parnas, 2011). How does current software engineering research compare against this definition? Is there too much focus currently on research into problems and techniques more associated with programming than software engineering? Are there opportunities to use Randell's description of software engineering to guide the community to new research directions? In this extended abstract, I motivate the keynote, which explores these questions and discusses how a consideration of the development streams used by multiple individuals to produce multiple versions of software opens up new avenues for impactful software engineering research.",Software Engineering,softwar engin research address softwar engin problem keynot,brian randel describ softwar engin multiperson develop multivers program david parna express pithi phrase impli everyth differenti softwar engin program parna 2011 current softwar engin research compar definit much focu current research problem techniqu associ program softwar engin opportun use randel descript softwar engin guid commun new research direct extend abstract motiv keynot explor question discuss consider develop stream use multipl individu produc multipl version softwar open new avenu impact softwar engin research,softwar engin research address softwar engin problem keynot brian randel describ softwar engin multiperson develop multivers program david parna express pithi phrase impli everyth differenti softwar engin program parna 2011 current softwar engin research compar definit much focu current research problem techniqu associ program softwar engin opportun use randel descript softwar engin guid commun new research direct extend abstract motiv keynot explor question discuss consider develop stream use multipl individu produc multipl version softwar open new avenu impact softwar engin research,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0837237924156166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07549939481412679,0.0,0.08203060159969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10163593959257515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16406120319938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10725927705324129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10241004958035535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884873042610848,0.07820987826362864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5416665773595174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085529943695853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08203060159969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1911854283086376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13738647829733405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09180764879846466,0.0,0.0955927141543188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497242728457912,0.0,0.11436468694647531,0.0,0.0,0.2623956358224706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10725927705324129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2804508181536955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5656623257081986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748621364228956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08277633667058679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Software Engineering Process and Methodology in Blockchain-Oriented Software Development: A Systematic Study,"Software Engineering is the process of systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach that has significant impact on large-scale and complex software development. Scores of well-established software process models have long been adopted in the software development life cycle that pour stakeholders towards the completion of final software products development. Within the boundary of advanced technology, various emerging and futuristic technology is evolving that really need the attention of software engineering community whether the conventional software process techniques are capable to inherit the core fundamental into the futuristic software development. In this paper, we study the impact of existing software engineering processes and models including Agile, and DevOps in Blockchain-Oriented Software Engineering. We also examine the essentiality of adopting state-of-art concepts and evolving the current soft-ware engineering process for blockchain-oriented systems. We discuss the insight of software project management practices in BOS development. The findings of this study indicate that utilizing state-of-art techniques in software processes for futur-istic technology would be challenging and promising research is needed extensively towards addressing and improving state-of - the-art software engineering processes and methodology for novel technologies.",Software Engineering,softwar engin process methodolog blockchainori softwar develop systemat studi,softwar engin process systemat disciplin quantifi approach signific impact largescal complex softwar develop score wellestablish softwar process model long adopt softwar develop life cycl pour stakehold toward complet final softwar product develop within boundari advanc technolog variou emerg futurist technolog evolv realli need attent softwar engin commun whether convent softwar process techniqu capabl inherit core fundament futurist softwar develop paper studi impact exist softwar engin process model includ agil devop blockchainori softwar engin also examin essenti adopt stateofart concept evolv current softwar engin process blockchainori system discuss insight softwar project manag practic bo develop find studi indic util stateofart techniqu softwar process futurist technolog would challeng promis research need extens toward address improv stateof theart softwar engin process methodolog novel technolog,softwar engin process methodolog blockchainori softwar develop systemat studi softwar engin process systemat disciplin quantifi approach signific impact largescal complex softwar develop score wellestablish softwar process model long adopt softwar develop life cycl pour stakehold toward complet final softwar product develop within boundari advanc technolog variou emerg futurist technolog evolv realli need attent softwar engin commun whether convent softwar process techniqu capabl inherit core fundament futurist softwar develop paper studi impact exist softwar engin process model includ agil devop blockchainori softwar engin also examin essenti adopt stateofart concept evolv current softwar engin process blockchainori system discuss insight softwar project manag practic bo develop find studi indic util stateofart techniqu softwar process futurist technolog would challeng promis research need extens toward address improv stateof theart softwar engin process methodolog novel technolog,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05713177664078707,0.13046187794360975,0.055424673167458006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799877460212861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040804254057518655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046203075939664544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05654504539534059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04316667636952798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05151957928067684,0.0,0.0,0.07054744231281716,0.05654504539534059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06432927322459776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06935473933926152,0.0,0.06823436711137892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05597637031344891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2096489388351736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05336916982785092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05713177664078707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3234215315776518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436449276550128,0.0718224638275064,0.0,0.050244557765987595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05436835813344424,0.05901276988358547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11195274062689782,0.0,0.0,0.04181713668158093,0.04757262697978696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07054744231281716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06935473933926152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05288913032079925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14109488462563433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08111895176785998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965948893208546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06346956091635754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03107060320682689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757262697978696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29463113675166,0.0,0.05773774836889623,0.0,0.0,0.05654504539534059,0.0718224638275064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038275030404605254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05488896951612883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6862203063784655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11883465325188904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030497519087116794,0.14638402973525763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10216944869705237,0.16623465675809326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802553976717094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053862011886109576,0.0,0.0,0.05288913032079925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06432927322459776,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Is there a ""software engineering ethics""? Comparing commercial and research software engineering","While ethical principles like fairness and honesty may be broad cultural or even universal virtues, many inputs into a professional software engineer's ethical code will be situational, depending on the nature of the engineer's employing institution and the line of business in which that organisation participates. We compare published codes of ethics for employees at Silicon Valley technology companies and at UK universities, to identify the commonalities and differences of the ethical values that guide engineering practice in each category of employer. This comparison represents the beginning of a context-dependent methodology for software engineering, in which practices are recommended based on the distinct properties of the problem domain and the solutions expected therein.",Software Engineering,softwar engin ethic compar commerci research softwar engin,ethic principl like fair honesti may broad cultur even univers virtu mani input profession softwar engin ethic code situat depend natur engin employ institut line busi organis particip compar publish code ethic employe silicon valley technolog compani uk univers identifi common differ ethic valu guid engin practic categori employ comparison repres begin contextdepend methodolog softwar engin practic recommend base distinct properti problem domain solut expect therein,softwar engin ethic compar commerci research softwar engin ethic principl like fair honesti may broad cultur even univers virtu mani input profession softwar engin ethic code situat depend natur engin employ institut line busi organis particip compar publish code ethic employe silicon valley technolog compani uk univers identifi common differ ethic valu guid engin practic categori employ comparison repres begin contextdepend methodolog softwar engin practic recommend base distinct properti problem domain solut expect therein,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05515029934200035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21470643417908755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735321708954378,0.0,0.10553826112451085,0.17036034864307492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12503098559090184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06484792312618833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789092569891986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19852601094576267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4218479376951985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5568875357993047,0.0,0.10929343854864838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137750715986096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07773647524497813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11607541163765696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09413574827478231,0.0,0.11607541163765696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819627199133565,0.08881387398908913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735321708954378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789092569891986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10222595989144477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14478411645415798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10553826112451085,0.0,0.07773647524497813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10553826112451085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137750715986096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10929343854864838,0.0,0.05824375077858714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137750715986096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610582152477147,0.08693837535929261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0632405109586628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22275501431972192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10553826112451085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Workshop on Bad Practice Smells in Novice Software Engineering Education,"This workshop aims to address the common bad practices and habits that novice software engineering students develop and how educators can detect them and guide students towards better practices before they become ingrained. The workshop explored this by soliciting contributions of bad practices educators have observed in teaching introductory software engineering. Contributions were workshopped to develop a compendium of bad practices, along with proposed remediations and subsequently shared with the software engineering education community. The workshop concluded with recommendations for using the compendium to improve software engineering education.",Software Engineering,workshop bad practic smell novic softwar engin educ,workshop aim address common bad practic habit novic softwar engin student develop educ detect guid student toward better practic becom ingrain workshop explor solicit contribut bad practic educ observ teach introductori softwar engin contribut workshop develop compendium bad practic along propos remedi subsequ share softwar engin educ commun workshop conclud recommend use compendium improv softwar engin educ,workshop bad practic smell novic softwar engin educ workshop aim address common bad practic habit novic softwar engin student develop educ detect guid student toward better practic becom ingrain workshop explor solicit contribut bad practic educ observ teach introductori softwar engin contribut workshop develop compendium bad practic along propos remedi subsequ share softwar engin educ commun workshop conclud recommend use compendium improv softwar engin educ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975516300531705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09112703678069302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12263575251406011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10310188443004141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114705490871524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12045867288475273,0.0879688893640248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19931217125157516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441963099593187,0.0,0.0,0.11932411304061086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5216974973681712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39445520832682845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09965608562578758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07140211782827992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12045867288475273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4061476450284709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06254727557158465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497423985438863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12045867288475273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3661595689322937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038219662916718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497423985438863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007633970897129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04822384616764916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Secure Modules for Undergraduate Software Engineering Courses,"Security affects every software component in different types of computing systems. Many vulnerabilities and attacks on software systems are due to security weaknesses in the software itself. During the process of software specification, development, or testing, security issues are either taken into consideration insufficiently or not at all. Such software, due to internal weaknesses is prone to new attacks. By teaching secure software engineering techniques for designing and developing software modules, students would learn systematic secure software development techniques, such as defect detecting and security testing. This paper presents a series of modules that are designed to be integrated into undergraduate software engineering courses from a security perspective. The goal of the modules is to teach the building of robust software security requirements, secure software design and development, and secure software verification through a secure software development lifecycle.",Software Engineering,secur modul undergradu softwar engin cours,secur affect everi softwar compon differ type comput system mani vulner attack softwar system due secur weak softwar process softwar specif develop test secur issu either taken consider insuffici softwar due intern weak prone new attack teach secur softwar engin techniqu design develop softwar modul student would learn systemat secur softwar develop techniqu defect detect secur test paper present seri modul design integr undergradu softwar engin cours secur perspect goal modul teach build robust softwar secur requir secur softwar design develop secur softwar verif secur softwar develop lifecycl,secur modul undergradu softwar engin cours secur affect everi softwar compon differ type comput system mani vulner attack softwar system due secur weak softwar process softwar specif develop test secur issu either taken consider insuffici softwar due intern weak prone new attack teach secur softwar engin techniqu design develop softwar modul student would learn systemat secur softwar develop techniqu defect detect secur test paper present seri modul design integr undergradu softwar engin cours secur perspect goal modul teach build robust softwar secur requir secur softwar design develop secur softwar verif secur softwar develop lifecycl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587909027176743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11087878764668624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709291619304526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587909027176743,0.0,0.04518856846877848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587909027176743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13402404406233254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546013992733837,0.0,0.04696324504234493,0.0,0.0,0.1659521456702624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040479368676793664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10427651843629132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13166295366376168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0619619503724811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04852466030334801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054268670123516626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041271428569492154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051162766626610255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2837166477218104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04452606155928865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02951352846195572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06701202203116627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03829740311014222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034983245989845604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042676526238810075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587909027176743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.613953199519323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5703521301976199,0.0,0.0,0.051162766626610255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05669380945546674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05793832785318375,0.06952406426113467,0.0,0.0,0.13904812852226933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09704932060669602,0.0,0.10232553325322051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587909027176743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587909027176743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
A Kind of 2-Stage Software Life Cycle and Cost Estimation Framework in Agile Methodology from a System Engineering Perspective,"Software cost estimate is essential not only for project plans but also for software budgeting. Many researchers research software engineering and software cost estimation from either software engineering or cost perspective. However, this non-systematic perspective or technology path leads to unnecessary conflicts both in academics and in engineering, such as Function Points Analysis treated as a financial or economic research method, software cost estimation treated only as a financial or economic tool, and software cost estimation treated as an unrelated tool to software development engineering. Software development disciplines have a direct and critical relationship to software cost estimation. This paper presents a basic 2-stage life cycle and related cost estimation framework, which illustrates cost structure and expresses in the equation to form a development-maintenance 2-stage module using agile. In this module, we assign software development to the first stage and combine software maintenance to the second stage. Under this framework, software development and cost estimation are connected. We use a quantile-based scale measure(QSC) to analyze and evaluate the percentage of test work in the projects whole work. It is illustrated that the share of the testing workload in the total workload occupies nearly 22 % , and the share of the management workload occupies 13% at toughly.",Software Engineering,kind 2stage softwar life cycl cost estim framework agil methodolog system engin perspect,softwar cost estim essenti project plan also softwar budget mani research research softwar engin softwar cost estim either softwar engin cost perspect howev nonsystemat perspect technolog path lead unnecessari conflict academ engin function point analysi treat financi econom research method softwar cost estim treat financi econom tool softwar cost estim treat unrel tool softwar develop engin softwar develop disciplin direct critic relationship softwar cost estim paper present basic 2stage life cycl relat cost estim framework illustr cost structur express equat form developmentmainten 2stage modul use agil modul assign softwar develop first stage combin softwar mainten second stage framework softwar develop cost estim connect use quantilebas scale measureqsc analyz evalu percentag test work project whole work illustr share test workload total workload occupi nearli 22 share manag workload occupi 13 toughli,kind 2stage softwar life cycl cost estim framework agil methodolog system engin perspect softwar cost estim essenti project plan also softwar budget mani research research softwar engin softwar cost estim either softwar engin cost perspect howev nonsystemat perspect technolog path lead unnecessari conflict academ engin function point analysi treat financi econom research method softwar cost estim treat financi econom tool softwar cost estim treat unrel tool softwar develop engin softwar develop disciplin direct critic relationship softwar cost estim paper present basic 2stage life cycl relat cost estim framework illustr cost structur express equat form developmentmainten 2stage modul use agil modul assign softwar develop first stage combin softwar mainten second stage framework softwar develop cost estim connect use quantilebas scale measureqsc analyz evalu percentag test work project whole work illustr share test workload total workload occupi nearli 22 share manag workload occupi 13 toughli,0.0,0.060187963944642826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13155259032694486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03355454794411158,0.0,0.03883090534044867,0.043887050727645524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04965417281137518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05151736621328868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.490806312268142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05087058570032772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11493369228382741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04965417281137518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18997079625540136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5018135434099327,0.0,0.0,0.03941547926540685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04965417281137518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058013253522121125,0.0,0.1367320562063923,0.0,0.04649866737045066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0354972378563157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052192901792973936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04349230000798459,0.04429232936475536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03276491328557763,0.058013253522121125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12280875366719074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025550278250064864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17403976056636336,0.0,0.0,0.052192901792973936,0.0,0.0,0.05703245850371831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033154602540335906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09299733474090131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04965417281137518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442407703103262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060187963944642826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05906174151761557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11602650704424225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4937618911222772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12545338585248317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05087058570032772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025079014186672972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034174921763669486,0.08858465872951073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09027365414574737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046449494196440115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07766181068089734,0.0
The Use of Grey Literature and Google Scholar in Software Engineering Systematic Literature Reviews,"Objective of the study is to calculate: a) grey literature evidence in the selected Systematic literature reviews (SLRs); b) Google Scholar indexing for the extracted primary studies from the selected SLRs. We have randomly selected 20+ SLRs from Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Springer Link and ACM. Result: a) Random selection of 20+ SLRs and grey literature calculation verifies that the grey literature percentage ranges around 5.7% to 9.1%; b) The second phase showed that Google Scholar was successful in retrieving around ~91% of the primary studies.",Software Engineering,use grey literatur googl scholar softwar engin systemat literatur review,object studi calcul grey literatur evid select systemat literatur review slr b googl scholar index extract primari studi select slr randomli select 20 slr scienc direct ieee xplore springer link acm result random select 20 slr grey literatur calcul verifi grey literatur percentag rang around 57 91 b second phase show googl scholar success retriev around 91 primari studi,use grey literatur googl scholar softwar engin systemat literatur review object studi calcul grey literatur evid select systemat literatur review slr b googl scholar index extract primari studi select slr randomli select 20 slr scienc direct ieee xplore springer link acm result random select 20 slr grey literatur calcul verifi grey literatur percentag rang around 57 91 b second phase show googl scholar success retriev around 91 primari studi,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11136436132036065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08521328700759889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12791237787655854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13771771476941277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.653030820342374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1186438069499166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324636531065258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170582217875411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06719906871904964,0.2129738430989407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324636531065258,0.0,0.0,0.4882201799538221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266707539286113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910064255547591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.219169204821458,0.0,0.12205504498845553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2699790887396482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05208845462485805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1186438069499166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Perceptions about Software Testing among UAE Software Students,"Software testing is one of the crucial supporting processes of software life cycle. Unfortunately for the software industry, the role is stigmatized, partly due to misperception and partly due to the treatment of the testing role within the software industry. The present study aims to analyse this situation to explore what might inhibit an individual from taking up a software testing career. In order to investigate this issue, we surveyed 132 senior students pursuing a degree in computer science and information and communication technology (ICT) related areas at three universities in the United Arab Emirates: UAE University in Al Ain, Sharjah University in Sharjah and New York University in Abu Dhabi. The students were asked to describe the PROs and CONs of taking up a career in software testing, and to describe the likelihood that they would take up the career themselves. The study identified 7 main PROs and 9 main CONs for pursuing a testing career, and indicated that the role of software tester is perceived as a social role, which may require as many soft skills as technical knowledge. The results also show that the UAE students have a stronger negative attitude towards software testing than do their counterparts where similar investigations have been carried out in different countries in the past three years.",Software Engineering,percept softwar test among uae softwar student,softwar test one crucial support process softwar life cycl unfortun softwar industri role stigmat partli due mispercept partli due treatment test role within softwar industri present studi aim analys situat explor might inhibit individu take softwar test career order investig issu survey 132 senior student pursu degre comput scienc inform commun technolog ict relat area three univers unit arab emir uae univers al sharjah univers sharjah new york univers abu dhabi student ask describ pro con take career softwar test describ likelihood would take career studi identifi 7 main pro 9 main con pursu test career indic role softwar tester perceiv social role may requir mani soft skill technic knowledg result also show uae student stronger neg attitud toward softwar test counterpart similar investig carri differ countri past three year,percept softwar test among uae softwar student softwar test one crucial support process softwar life cycl unfortun softwar industri role stigmat partli due mispercept partli due treatment test role within softwar industri present studi aim analys situat explor might inhibit individu take softwar test career order investig issu survey 132 senior student pursu degre comput scienc inform commun technolog ict relat area three univers unit arab emir uae univers al sharjah univers sharjah new york univers abu dhabi student ask describ pro con take career softwar test describ likelihood would take career studi identifi 7 main pro 9 main con pursu test career indic role softwar tester perceiv social role may requir mani soft skill technic knowledg result also show uae student stronger neg attitud toward softwar test counterpart similar investig carri differ countri past three year,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05972578325965925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04566430472447855,0.08037698396983103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05669378490463131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406119463264892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057655894511230835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05323883465402198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16381931480000264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047690698973391704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285320184821637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531582701318435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05716924554309437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12055465199161453,0.057655894511230835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306316540263687,0.0,0.0,0.06393654088856035,0.0,0.07300036585581195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14398261176844102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06027732599580726,0.06531582701318435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05245830327171352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05866495448282228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06922965944293459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04512001997292755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041215451429960144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06757424602701165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05027927639721174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04077540021393639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30544608687748415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05622900968459087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08190965740000132,0.0,0.08190965740000132,0.0,0.0,0.47997099050045766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26717485857881274,0.08865908621966523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05716924554309437,0.06922965944293459,0.0,0.0,0.2506952124477728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406119463264892,0.0,0.04650856998433439,0.42194128197065084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14398261176844102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06604157259684137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08037698396983103,0.3276386296000053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07199130588422051,0.0,0.0,0.06838539418307875

Towards a Green Quotient for Software Projects,"As sustainability takes center stage across businesses, green and energy-efficient choices are more crucial than ever. While it is becoming increasingly evident that software and the software industry are substantial and rapidly evolving contributors to carbon emissions, there is a dearth of approaches to create actionable awareness about this during the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Can software teams comprehend how green are their projects? Here we provide an industry perspective on why this is a challenging and worthy problem that needs to be addressed. We also outline an approach to quickly gauge the “greenness” of a software project based on the choices made across different SDLC dimensions and present the initial encouraging feedback this approach has received.",Software Engineering,toward green quotient softwar project,sustain take center stage across busi green energyeffici choic crucial ever becom increasingli evid softwar softwar industri substanti rapidli evolv contributor carbon emiss dearth approach creat action awar softwar develop lifecycl sdlc softwar team comprehend green project provid industri perspect challeng worthi problem need address also outlin approach quickli gaug green softwar project base choic made across differ sdlc dimens present initi encourag feedback approach receiv,toward green quotient softwar project sustain take center stage across busi green energyeffici choic crucial ever becom increasingli evid softwar softwar industri substanti rapidli evolv contributor carbon emiss dearth approach creat action awar softwar develop lifecycl sdlc softwar team comprehend green project provid industri perspect challeng worthi problem need address also outlin approach quickli gaug green softwar project base choic made across differ sdlc dimens present initi encourag feedback approach receiv,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1965469332334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724206265524797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06945153928276686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23592207364592177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06168655489485462,0.10277470402243039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347253831325319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10949267789804766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947272675122181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07253351328039838,0.0,0.0,0.13984929997174508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12224658391915959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6185330613666572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18335341354770873,0.0,0.0,0.11804635361981891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143414879295212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08220544530387881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12007641296862617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06862372828177966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08694957968940592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28873022180367824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07253351328039838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43799713105184107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12983233703821748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12709539395063313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12709539395063313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044363756723342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Diversity in Software Engineering,"Studies about diversity in Software Engineering (SE) are important to understand the disparity occurring nowadays at information technology workplaces. The goal of this work is to analyze the characteristics of diversity in SE and how to adapt SE practices when we have teams with diversity characteristics. We collected data by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and semi-structured interviews aiming to identify what impacts of diversity can be observed in software development teams.

Dual-Track Agile in Software Engineering Education,"The fields of Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction have traditionally evolved in parallel, with little cross-pollination, both in industry and academia. However, effectively delivering software products offering superior user experiences requires a tight collaboration between professionals from both fields. In recent years, some approaches combining the two perspectives have been proposed in industry, including dual-track agile software development. Yet, very few courses cover those integrated approaches in academia, and it appears that no publication so far has reported the existence of a scholarly course covering dual-track agile. This paper introduces a course that addresses the divide between Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction through an integrated approach to requirements engineering and interaction design, in the context of dual-track agile. The course design combines traditional and flipped-classroom delivery, together with project-based learning. During the course project, students learn to design and implement software systems that address real problems and satisfy real stakeholders' needs by being useful, usable, and enjoyable to use. This paper documents the author's experience designing and teaching the course over the past four years.

Are You a Real Software Engineer? Best Practices in Online Recruitment for Software Engineering Studies,"Online research platforms, such as Prolific, offer rapid access to diverse participant pools but also pose unique challenges in participant qualification and skill verification. Previous studies reported mixed outcomes and challenges in leveraging online platforms for the recruitment of qualified software engineers. Drawing from our experience in conducting three different studies using Prolific, we propose best practices for recruiting and screening participants to enhance the quality and relevance of both qualitative and quantitative software engineering (SE) research samples. We propose refined best practices for recruitment in SE research on Prolific. (1) Iterative and controlled prescreening, enabling focused and manageable assessment of submissions (2) task-oriented and targeted questions that assess technical skills, knowledge of basic SE concepts, and professional engagement. (3) AI detection to verify the authenticity of free-text responses. (4) Qualitative and manual assessment of responses, ensuring authenticity and relevance in participant answers (5) Additional layers of prescreening are necessary when necessary to collect data relevant to the topic of the study. (6) Fair or generous compensation post-qualification to incentivize genuine participation. By sharing our experiences and lessons learned, we contribute to the development of effective and rigorous methods for SE empirical research. particularly the ongoing effort to estab-lish guidelines to ensure reliable data collection. These practices have the potential to transferability to other participant recruitment platforms.",Software Engineering,real softwar engin best practic onlin recruit softwar engin studi,onlin research

Intensity of Misconception in Software Engineering,"""Misunderstanding is generally simpler than true understanding, and hence has more potential for popularity."" - Raheel Farooq. Misconception can be a great distortion to someone's carrier. The misconception of believing that software engineers can troubleshoot personal computing problems motivated the implementation of the research. The research is aimed at finding out the severity of misconception in Software Engineering field. Fifty-one voluntary software engineering students from year 1, 2 and 3 participated in the research. The data were fetched using questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS statistical application. The misconceptions were analyzed in the discussion section to dissect and compare it with the real view from the scholars. The result concluded that the participants hold a great misconception about their field of study. However, the severity of the misconception feared that it might cause a negative effect to the software development industries which is related to the cost and the quality of the software production.

TABot: A Teaching Assistant Chatbot for Software Engineering Courses,"The Software Engineering (SE) course primarily teaches students how to develop and maintain high-quality software using systematic processes, methods, and tools. Five teaching issues in the SE course, including course breadth, limited teaching assistant resources, limited teaching interaction, learning weaknesses, and poor team communication, hinder students from absorbing technical concepts, knowledge, and skills for necessary subjects in the SE field. In recent years, Digital Interactive Learning has received increasing attention. Among them, Chatbot was significantly under the spotlight. It can confirm the user's intention by analyzing the content of the dialogue and simulating a human conversation. To address the teaching issues for the SE course and leverage the benefits brought by Chatbots, in this study, we designed a Chatbot system, called TABot, to assist teaching and learning, especially for the SE course. This study designed multiple features that support students' learning, such as frequently asked questions, requests for course materials, and adaptive quiz practices. Furthermore, TABot also provides team supporting functions, such as reading the user requirements of their team project, group member contribution analysis, and GitHub commit retrieval. After being applied to an SE course, 80% of the students agreed that TABot could help them learn better for the SE course.",Software Engineering,tabot teach assist chatbot softwar engin cours,softwar

The Trajectory of Turkey-educated software practitioners working in different countries,"To bridge the skills gap in the software industry, we have already conducted a survey, whose results will benefit both the industry and as well as the academia, by creating the awareness of the expected skillset and the corresponding gaps in the academic curriculum (mostly for Turkish institutions). One of the opportunities the survey data provided as a further study is to analyze the trajectory of 628 software practitioners, who completed their undergraduate degree in Turkey. We believe that such a study will help to characterize and understand the possible educational and career paths of Turkey-educated software practitioners working in different countries. With the help of such initial inputs, we hope that Turkish researchers will study more qualitative approaches to investigate the root causes of these phenomena by increasing more industry-academia collaborations (IACs).",Software Engineering,trajectori turkeyeduc softwar practition work differ countri,bridg skill gap softwar industri alreadi conduct survey whose result benefit industri well academia creat awar expect skillset correspond gap academ curriculum mostli turkish institut one opportun survey data provid studi analyz trajectori 628 softwar practition complet undergradu degre turkey believ studi help character understand possibl educ career path turkeyeduc softwar practition work differ countri help initi input hope turkish research studi qualit approach investig root caus phenomena increas industryacademia collabor iac,trajectori turkeyeduc softwar practition work differ countri bridg skill gap softwar industri alreadi conduct survey whose result benefit industri well academia creat awar expect skillset correspond gap academ curriculum mostli turkish institut one opportun survey data provid studi analyz trajectori 628 softwar practition complet undergradu degre turkey believ studi help character understand possibl educ career path turkeyeduc softwar practition work differ countri help initi input hope turkish research studi qualit approach investig root caus phenomena increas industryacademia collabor iac,0.0,0.15022963610601378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10954242723087149,0.0,0.0,0.09483372329546574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12393720976271651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320384925182583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448015416166924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448015416166924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11979506734152048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320384925182583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07990792014874543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17493801292383296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254249280145331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15022963610601378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23959013468304097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09838134934141178,0.22110801185681786,0.0,0.0,0.14235346945986108,0.15656632381035535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11979506734152048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10759677239389982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338891987371971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.140053859148511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44225572794618084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08746900646191648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856108210751794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07478573016491022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15022963610601378,0.0,0.0,0.3521238864042696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24391303815180762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539467719921182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11979506734152048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11376143280521377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19384449636236284,0.0

"“Software is the easy part of Software Engineering” - Lessons and Experiences from A Large-Scale, Multi-Team Capstone Course","Capstone courses in undergraduate software engineering are a critical final milestone for students. These courses allow students to create a software solution and demonstrate the knowledge they accumulated in their degrees. However, a typical capstone project team is small containing no more than 5 students and function independently from other teams. To better reflect real-world software development and meet industry demands, we introduce in this paper our novel capstone course. Each student was assigned to a large-scale, multi-team (i.e., company) of up to 20 students to collaboratively build software. Students placed in a company gained first-hand experiences with respect to multi-team coordination, integration, communication, agile, and teamwork to build a microservices based project. Furthermore, each company was required to implement plug-and-play so that their services would be compatible with another company, thereby sharing common APIs. Through developing the product in autonomous sub-teams, the students enhanced not only their technical abilities but also their soft skills such as communication and coordination. More importantly, experiencing the challenges that arose from the multi-team project trained students to realize the pitfalls and advantages of organizational culture. Among many lessons learned from this course experience, students learned the critical importance of building team trust. We provide detailed information about our course structure, lessons learned, and propose recommendations for other universities and programs. Our work concerns educators interested in launching similar capstone projects so that students in other institutions can reap the benefits of large-scale, multi-team development.",Software

Effective software refactoring process,"According to the plan-driven software development processes, software creation is comprised of a sequence of activities which starts with requirement analysis and continues with system design, implementation, testing and deployment and finally ends with maintenance phase. Although each phase contributes to the total development cost, research shows that more than 60% of it comes from maintenance. The quality and clarity of the system design or implementation subsequently is responsible for the cost of maintenance. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect and eliminate any design or implementation flaws to reduce the cost of development especially incurred by maintenance phase. This study discusses the importance of refactoring in software engineering and difficulties one may face with applying refactoring. We also lay out the factors that affect execution of certain refactoring. We present a discussion that takes us to a conceptual solution for more effective refactoring research and we share our observations and personal opinions in how to apply refactoring more effectively.",Software Engineering,effect softwar refactor process,accord plandriven softwar develop process softwar creation compris sequenc activ start requir analysi continu system design implement test deploy final end mainten phase although phase contribut total develop cost research show 60 come mainten qualiti clariti system design implement subsequ respons cost mainten therefor great import detect elimin design implement flaw reduc cost develop especi incur mainten phase studi discuss import refactor softwar engin difficulti one may face appli refactor also lay factor affect execut certain refactor present discuss take us conceptu solut effect refactor research share observ person opinion appli refactor effect,effect softwar refactor process accord plandriven softwar develop process softwar creation compris sequenc activ start requir analysi continu system design implement test deploy final end mainten phase although phase contribut total develop cost research show 60 come mainten qualiti clariti system design implement subsequ respons cost mainten therefor great import detect elimin design implement flaw reduc cost develop especi incur mainten phase studi discuss import refactor softwar engin difficulti one may face appli refactor also lay factor affect execut certain refactor present discuss take us conceptu solut effect refactor research share observ person opinion appli refactor effect,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357085290984571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10388803863842137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11932512248640474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020389175658656,0.0,0.08124325441283473,0.0,0.18364376500802393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357085290984571,0.10041596554009262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30806417011469917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13426923913639333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10778627109642938,0.0,0.22724276401258656,0.0,0.0850633325979367,0.0,0.0,0.1803509431653949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259271712692095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18364376500802393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21450557274226364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357085290984571,0.0,0.07949258764826951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10778627109642938,0.11386101513480007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09354099021154265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357085290984571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24928787368205282,0.17289194846148626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10041596554009262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1213771729989623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09019097387481713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3707125587295371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06936711327034446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267285293555212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09182188250401196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09630758197104865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729890773738608,0.13170470352023728,0.0,0.0,0.11067878677241468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1213771729989623,0.08644597423074313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2951612351634731,0.09829546344597975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06815184124402902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10494222126047506,0.0,0.12847218897976181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266981935055527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051350905248057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Toward Formalizing The Emergent Behavior in Software Engineering,"The emergence phenomenon has been widely discussed in many fields such as: Biology, natural sciences, control theory, computer science... to name few. Different definitions and many attempts were made in order to shape one concrete definition that serves as a reference. In the midst of this struggle, we propose a new attempt to define the emergence phenomenon from a software engineering perspective. Whereas many fields study the phenomenon based on observation and report, software systems engineering includes the fact that we are not only observing but further participating in the creation of the system of interest, giving a different perspective in defining and understanding the phenomenon. In this paper, we propose both informal and formal definitions, discuss some characteristics and list categories of the emergent behavior and how can we harness such a behavior.",Software Engineering,toward formal emerg behavior softwar engin,emerg phenomenon wide discuss mani field biolog natur scienc control theori comput scienc name differ definit mani attempt made order shape one concret definit serv refer midst struggl propos new attempt defin emerg phenomenon softwar engin perspect wherea mani field studi phenomenon base observ report softwar system engin includ fact observ particip creation system interest give differ perspect defin understand phenomenon paper propos inform formal definit discuss characterist list categori emerg behavior har behavior,toward formal emerg behavior softwar engin emerg phenomenon wide discuss mani field biolog natur scienc control theori comput scienc name differ definit mani attempt made order shape one concret definit serv refer midst struggl propos new attempt defin emerg phenomenon softwar engin perspect wherea mani field studi phenomenon base observ report softwar system engin includ fact observ particip creation system interest give differ perspect defin understand phenomenon paper propos inform formal definit discuss characterist list categori emerg behavior har behavior,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06197469729372498,0.0,0.38306719742785744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000412618563739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134998265868351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08735572752040702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133450779101697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25031912333811485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14574464522667083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18252433450222094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3907851497006921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23702408286596455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18252433450222094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134998265868351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08809933668045043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206372986549723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11487558536256114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27631480608114456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000412618563739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08015731541064948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2412745973099446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08964120009132309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10578427630409887,0.0,0.0,0.05313124778970369,0.0,0.11487558536256114,0.0,0.0,0.2412745973099446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12528005136505535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12515956166905742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206372986549723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22002152380471185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06773641058613615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10430252884390666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12768906580928582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10091281712717512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09980386365310327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10449422244219651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Obtaining Insights into the Interplay Between Systems and Software Engineering,"The high-tech equipment industry is adopting approaches like Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to improve their practices. Instantiations of these approaches do not necessarily align across disciplines. Given the importance of software aspects in systems, the interplay between software and other engineering disciplines should be carefully addressed. Decision makers are interested in mitigating any risks in the collaboration of specialists in different disciplines. This short positioning paper proposes an applied research approach to identify such risks for later mitigation. The approach is inspired by grounded theory (we constructed concepts from interviews) and systems thinking. Work still to do is to cross-check identified concepts with literature. This research is in progress and we welcome discussions and critical opinions.

A Research Perspective on Integrating Knowledge Management for Software Engineering,"The software development organizations strive to develop quality software to survive and gain competitive edge in the unpredictable competitive environment. However, common view regarding software development is that the projects are not accomplished in the due constraints of budget and time. In addition, the software delivered is low in quality. Software developers may carry out development of similar softwares from scratch without realizing that the fast and better quality softwares are developed by storing and reprocessing the knowledge of previously developed softwares. Hence, software engineering organizations must certainly adapt knowledge management practices for enhancing performance. This study explores the different perspectives of knowledge management in software engineering in the current literature and presents the future research prospects.",Software Engineering,research perspect integr knowledg manag softwar engin,softwar develop organ strive develop qualiti softwar surviv gain competit edg unpredict competit environ howev common view regard softwar develop project accomplish due constraint budget time addit softwar deliv low qualiti softwar develop may carri develop similar softwar scratch without realiz fast better qualiti softwar develop store reprocess knowledg previous develop softwar henc softwar engin organ must certainli adapt knowledg manag practic enhanc perform studi explor differ perspect knowledg manag softwar engin current literatur present futur research prospect,research perspect integr knowledg manag softwar engin softwar develop organ strive develop qualiti softwar surviv gain competit edg unpredict competit environ howev common view regard softwar develop project accomplish due constraint budget time addit softwar deliv low qualiti softwar develop may carri develop similar softwar scratch without realiz fast better qualiti softwar develop store reprocess knowledg previous develop softwar henc softwar engin organ must certainli adapt knowledg manag practic enhanc perform studi explor differ perspect knowledg manag softwar engin current literatur present futur research prospect,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310947577232291,0.07877289354855485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08866250862212872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734376627964796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310947577232291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07387837637560583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322813780954849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05624383032850339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244320998440013,0.0,0.09310947577232291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18293834781715715,0.06918627357510863,0.0,0.07969341003452882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07702995282885358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965998186699229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108781730910668,0.09310947577232291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05697196774021176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06742231536862862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34437072884201086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788585790777978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09855212369570258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20941138488286482,0.0,0.07702995282885358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734376627964796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1895845330863477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060979449272385716,0.18621895154464582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06278700139913475,0.0,0.0,0.05321211058768304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07462892149848831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2113120729327617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005664759929154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965998186699229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10103181346646908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6226570020311601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052279864939714565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0632606238903236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734376627964796,0.0,0.0
"A Survey on Blockchain Acquainted Software Requirements Engineering: Model, Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions","Requirements are the basis of software development practices. Ambiguities in requirements lead a project to a point of failure or penalize it with a high budget and time for defect traceability. The ever-growing demand for advanced computing systems has increased the complexity of Software Requirements Engineering (SRE) practices. Blockchain systems require specialized SRE practices as the issues of Requirement Traceability (RT), developer/client confidentiality, and Requirement Negotiation (RN) typically exist in conventional approaches, which require more improvement. Moreover, blockchain technology incorporates the capacity to function as an infrastructure for the SRE framework providing transparency, security, and reliability. Even though the significance of studying blockchain in the context of SRE is evident, it is still in its infancy. None of the previous studies surveyed this domain to the best of our knowledge. We aim to summarize the scholarly contributions of blockchain acquainted SRE from 2015 to 2021 and to provide academia and practitioners with in-depth knowledge about this domain. In this article, we have provided a novel comprehensive review of the aspects of blockchain-acquainted SRE practices. We have presented SRE-based quality improvement factors and outlined the need for blockchain technology in this domain. Furthermore, we have classified SRE practices based on blockchain engineering. In addition, we have proposed a generic SRE model built on blockchain infrastructure along with its workflows. Similarly, we have provided implementation guidelines for the future development guidance of SRE applications built on blockchain technology. Finally, we have presented the current research challenges and provided future directions based on blockchain acquainted SRE.",Software Engineering,survey blockchain acquaint softwar requir engin

Investigating Cultural Dispersion: on the Role of Cultural Differences in Software Development Teams,"Software development, inherently a social activity, involves individuals across diverse geographical and cultural settings. Despite this nature, the existing Global Software Engineering research body encounters limitations, making the achieved results challenging to use by practitioners. This Ph.D. research project seeks to overcome these constraints by crafting a theoretical framework. The framework systematically captures cultural differences, exploring their impact on various aspects of software development and delving into practitioners' strategies for managing these influences. Additionally, the project aims to significantly contribute to the professional software development landscape by transferring research findings to practitioners through practical tools.

Application of Software Reliability in Civil Aircraft Airborne Software Development,"Airborne software has become an important factor affecting aircraft reliability. The OEM of civil aircraft pays great attention to the safety and reliability of airborne software. Due to human factors contribute to the defects of airborne software, effectively removing airborne software defects caused by human factors is the basic practice to improve software reliability. To carry out software reliability assurance for airborne software with software with different levels, we try to apply software reliability engineering methods or techniques in the development of airborne software, to avoid, identify, eliminate or reduce software defects and enhance airborne software reliability assurance capabilities, as the supplemental and support assurance measures for DO-178B/C in software development process.",Software Engineering,applic softwar reliabl civil aircraft airborn softwar develop,airborn softwar becom import factor affect aircraft reliabl oem civil aircraft pay great attent safeti reliabl airborn softwar due human factor contribut defect airborn softwar effect remov airborn softwar defect caus human factor basic practic improv softwar reliabl carri softwar reliabl assur airborn softwar softwar differ level tri appli softwar reliabl engin method techniqu develop airborn softwar avoid identifi elimin reduc softwar defect enhanc airborn softwar reliabl assur capabl supplement support assur measur do178bc softwar develop process,applic softwar reliabl civil aircraft airborn softwar develop airborn softwar becom import factor affect aircraft reliabl oem civil aircraft pay great attent safeti reliabl airborn softwar due human factor contribut defect airborn softwar effect remov airborn softwar defect caus human factor basic practic improv softwar reliabl carri softwar reliabl assur airborn softwar softwar differ level tri appli softwar reliabl engin method techniqu develop airborn softwar avoid identifi elimin reduc softwar defect enhanc airborn softwar reliabl assur capabl supplement support assur measur do178bc softwar develop process,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184712243138315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06298218432620678,0.04934936441711499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07125856517401787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06673010810006222,0.0,0.0,0.07809919865752771,0.0,0.07591645432880974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06887701143203864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12370576638255965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05029091674410187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06477573488010877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04904433508668813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05452531217285493,0.06186351647599512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23429759597258312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08475934083549677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13346021620012444,0.0,0.060286257694293605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05929475779394195,0.04934936441711499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06964232650417584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07043547724264293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047020835844968634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05614155084269694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04346262229436323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06605900156149411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.476963510104403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637557950533879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7592103379416861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060286257694293605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060286257694293605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Applying Human Values Theory to Software Engineering Practice: Lessons and Implications,"The study of human values in software engineering (SE) is increasingly recognised as a fundamental human-centric issue of SE decision making. However, values studies in SE still face a number of issues, including the difficulty of eliciting values in a systematic and structured way, the challenges of measuring and tracking values over time, and the lack of practice-based understanding of values among software practitioners. This paper aims to help address these issues by: 1) outlining a research framework that supports a systematic approach to values elicitation, analysis, and understanding; 2) introducing tools and techniques that help elicit and measure values during SE decision making processes in a systematic way; and 3) applying such tools to a month-long research sprint co-designed with an industry partner and conducted with 27 software practitioners. The case study builds on lessons from an earlier pilot (12 participants) and combines in-situ observations with the use of two values-informed tools: the Values Q-Sort (V-QS), and the Values-Retro. The V-QS adapts instruments from values research to the SE context, the Values-Retro adapts existing SE techniques to values theory.

Operationalizing Human Values in Software Engineering: A Survey,"Human values (e.g., pleasure, privacy, and social justice) are what a person or a society considers important. Inability to address them in software-intensive systems can result in numerous undesired consequences (e.g., financial losses) for individuals and communities. Various solutions (e.g., methodologies, techniques) are developed to help “operationalize values in software”. The ultimate goal is to ensure building software (better) reflects and respects human values. In this survey, “operationalizing values” is referred to as the process of identifying human values and translating them to accessible and concrete concepts so that they can be implemented, validated, verified, and measured in software . This paper provides a deep understanding of the research landscape on operationalizing values in software engineering, covering 51 primary studies. It also presents an analysis and taxonomy of 51 solutions for operationalizing values in software engineering. Our survey reveals that most solutions attempt to help operationalize values in the early phases (requirements and design) of the software development life cycle. However, the later phases (implementation and testing) and other aspects of software development (e.g., “team organization”) still need adequate consideration. We outline implications for research and practice and identify open issues and future research directions to advance this area.",Software Engineering,operation human valu softwar engin survey,human valu eg pleasur privaci social justic person societi consid import inabl address softwareintens system result numer undesir consequ eg financi loss individu commun variou solut eg methodolog techniqu develop help operation valu softwar ultim goal ensur build softwar better reflect respect human valu survey operation valu refer process identifi human valu translat access concret concept implement valid verifi measur softwar paper provid deep understand research landscap operation valu softwar engin cover 51 primari studi also present analysi taxonomi 51 solut operation valu softwar engin survey reveal solut attempt help operation valu earli phase requir design softwar develop life cycl howev later phase implement test aspect softwar develop eg team organ still need adequ consider outlin implic research practic identifi open issu futur research direct advanc area,operation human valu softwar engin survey human valu eg pleasur privaci social justic person societi consid import inabl address softwareintens system result numer undesir consequ eg financi loss individu commun variou solut eg methodolog techniqu develop help operation valu softwar ultim goal ensur build softwar better reflect respect human valu survey operation valu refer process identifi human valu translat access concret concept implement valid verifi measur softwar paper provid deep understand research landscap operation valu softwar engin cover 51 primari studi also present analysi taxonomi 51 solut operation valu softwar engin survey reveal solut attempt help operation valu earli phase requir design softwar develop life cycl howev later phase implement test aspect softwar develop eg team organ still need adequ consider outlin implic research practic identifi open issu futur research direct advanc area,0.0,0.0,0.06104860907311275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057762196690031256,0.0,0.05603625619956394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041254508213170955,0.0,0.04774166250013588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051218872795627965,0.0,0.0,0.07132589739809359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06791932765794123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07549520180172035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05208807159120612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06503911398185405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05603625619956394,0.07012003355485154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06791932765794123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044512197447426995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10598115403441093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06104860907311275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3084838303076953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1401387100330119,0.0,0.06104860907311275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05445635174707918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06595072915122477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11801657063316809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04364299865184884,0.2286759646568144,0.0,0.10329683651283517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09766076471390014,0.05079898086366653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057762196690031256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07132589739809359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060343453514162114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07132589739809359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04883038235695007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07261498812563318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06333936046782661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07261498812563318,0.0,0.03141345148418486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14522997625126635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048097566682464815,0.0,0.0,0.040762784975761676,0.0,0.0,0.07261498812563318,0.0,0.0372352801556042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04308521380891601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739996514637607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04542381261679771,0.11609212759730893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036837724633513085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739996514637607,0.3468961989309875,0.17328659007009375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06898729859021187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040048644369928894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18763247823321724,0.030834043673173512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07549520180172035,0.0,0.05164841825641758,0.0,0.05445635174707918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059008285316584044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012003355485154,0.6310803019936637,0.05347273492933363,0.0,0.06503911398185405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Software Intelligence through Knowledge Management of Document Repositories,"Ever-growing of software engineering (SE) data requires a structured method to managing it. Software intelligence (SI) helps developers and practitioners for improving decision making process across the development of software process. Software data repositories store large volume of inefficient data which can be used by applying software intelligence to extract actionable and insightful knowledge. This knowledge can be saved in software repositories to use for existing and forthcoming projects. This paper presents creating of new software data repositories and using it to manage knowledge of two types of software engineering data: Software requirement specifications and code smells.

Sentiment Analysis in Jira Software Repositories,"Mining Software Repositories is a field of study whose main task is to extract valuable information from a large amount of data available within software repositories. This information about systems and projects can be exploited in different ways improving the development processes in Software Engineering. A new research area makes use of this data for analyzing the software professionals' emotional state and their relationship with different factors such as productivity and quality in tasks. In our study, we applied a supervised classification model to predict sentiments contained in issue comments in open source projects hosted in Jira repositories. The main objective is verifying if sentiments are related to issue comments and factors such as issue resolution types (Resolved or Unresolved) as well as the time of day and the day of the week, in which the comments were written. Our results show that comments in unresolved issues tend to express less positive and more negative sentiments regarding the comments in resolved issues. In addition, we also obtained interesting results regarding the sentiments in comments and the time/day of the week of publication.",Software Engineering,sentiment analysi jira softwar repositori,mine softwar repositori field studi whose main task extract valuabl inform larg amount data avail within softwar repositori inform system project exploit differ way improv develop process softwar engin new research area make use data analyz softwar profession emot state relationship differ factor product qualiti task studi appli supervis classif model predict sentiment contain issu comment open sourc project host jira repositori main object verifi sentiment relat issu comment factor issu resolut type resolv unresolv well time day day week comment written result show comment unresolv issu tend express less posit neg sentiment regard comment resolv issu addit also obtain interest result regard sentiment comment timeday week public,sentiment analysi jira softwar repositori mine softwar repositori field studi whose main task extract valuabl inform larg amount data avail within softwar repositori inform system project exploit differ way improv develop process softwar engin new research area make use data analyz softwar profession emot state relationship differ factor product qualiti task studi appli supervis classif model predict sentiment contain issu comment open sourc project host jira repositori main object verifi sentiment relat issu comment factor issu resolut type resolv unresolv well time day day week comment written result show comment unresolv issu tend express less posit neg sentiment regard comment resolv issu addit also obtain interest result regard sentiment comment timeday week public,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09788037563033888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0669170643241754,0.0,0.07743958269861795,0.08752293732079844,0.08752293732079844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08307980761197277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10021284346699152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12509440307106606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12769072337376527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05730240571547874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397731374701788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075770879189975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373852214060068,0.0,0.21706047010069018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08752293732079844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685781443579305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16897939101250434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11569449912007329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46846718077934335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09089386646463607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21099398647159764,0.0,0.0,0.09089386646463607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06651563959125177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07687307790079223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10549699323579882,0.0,0.09369343615586867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10273990024984718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373852214060068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11016885704360838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060397657013052525,0.0,0.09468720139052662,0.11373852214060068,0.0,0.18546244882210802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373852214060068,0.08752293732079844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24006294833911535,0.0,0.099024176440011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0627692560678682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1195056005088944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08239871997725713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35167785690428105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373852214060068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12992217468940556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05001450200764838,0.0,0.0,0.18738687231173734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07860538505136658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373852214060068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04631657973973775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10549699323579882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10273990024984718,0.09089386646463607,0.0,0.0,0.10549699323579882,0.0,0.0,0.0
What is Discussed About Software Engineering Ethics on Stack Exchange (Q&A) Websites? A Case Study,"Software engineering ethics has been an interest of the software engineering community for over two decades, as evidenced by the creation of the joint ACM/IEEE-CS Soft-ware Engineering Code of Ethics. When reviewing the cur-rent software engineering literature, it was found that Stack Exchange question-and-answer (Q&A) websites are particularly good means of gaining a better understanding on a given subject: what topics are addressed within a subject area, the popularity of these topics, and the difficulty of these topics. As such, this paper utilizes Stack Exchange Q&A websites to review software engineering ethics and presents a case study that aims to provide a better understanding of the presence of software engineering ethics on three popular Stack Exchange Q&A websites, which are Stack Overflow (SO), Software Engineering (SE), and Project Management (PM). The study analyzes over 2,170 posts, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to better understand what ethic-related topics are discussed. Subsequently, the authors analyzed the popularity and difficulty of each identified topic. The study found that users discuss six ethic-related topics, which are as follows: web scraping, software quality, software security, open-source software usage, team and employers, and software billing. Moreover, the results revealed that software security is the most popular and the most difficult topic. This study highlights ethic-related challenges that are faced by Q&A website users. Software practitioners, researchers, and educators can utilize the results presented in this study to pursue new avenues when addressing pressing issues related to software engineering

Digitalization of Swedish Government Agencies - A Perspective Through the Lens of a Software Development Census,"Software engineering is at the core of the digitalization of society. Ill-informed decisions can have major consequences, as made evident in the 2017 government crisis in Sweden, originating in a data breach caused by an outsourcing deal made by the Swedish Transport Agency. Many Government Agencies (GovAgs) in Sweden are rapidly undergoing a digital transition, thus it is important to overview how widespread, and mature, software development is in this part of the public sector. We present a software development census of Swedish GovAgs, complemented by document analysis and a survey. We show that 39.2% of the GovAgs develop software internally, some matching the number of developers in large companies. Our findings suggest that the development largely resembles private sector counterparts, and that established best practices are implemented. Still, we identify improvement potential in the areas of strategic sourcing, openness, collaboration across GovAgs, and quality requirements. The Swedish Government has announced the establishment of a new digitalization agency next year, and our hope is that the software engineering community will contribute its expertise with a clear voice.",Software Engineering,digit swedish govern agenc perspect len softwar develop censu,softwar engin core digit societi illinform decis major consequ made evid 2017 govern crisi sweden origin data breach caus outsourc deal made swedish transport agenc mani govern agenc govag sweden rapidli undergo digit transit thu import overview widespread matur softwar develop part public sector present softwar develop censu swedish govag complement document analysi survey show 392 govag develop softwar intern match number develop larg compani find suggest develop larg resembl privat sector counterpart establish best practic implement still identifi improv potenti area strateg sourc open collabor across govag qualiti requir swedish govern announc establish new digit agenc next year hope softwar engin commun contribut expertis clear voic,digit swedish govern agenc perspect len softwar develop censu softwar engin core digit societi illinform decis major consequ made evid 2017 govern crisi sweden origin data breach caus outsourc deal made swedish transport agenc mani govern agenc govag sweden rapidli undergo digit transit thu import overview widespread matur softwar develop part public sector present softwar develop censu swedish govag complement document analysi survey show 392 govag develop softwar intern match number develop larg compani find suggest develop larg resembl privat sector counterpart establish best practic implement still identifi improv potenti area strateg sourc open collabor across govag qualiti requir swedish govern announc establish new digit agenc next year hope softwar engin commun contribut expertis clear voic,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09639450701168631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07883589638093191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845778202309726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391885490462075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073992102928228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11778058748031832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08601312982419079,0.1157893422656157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09744049166326046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391885490462075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06499655787065635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10890456212324116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35001375487351843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4238556027984184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273499811682366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15427420893422727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20655857430812166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09852318493574565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528712945198294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063370151223462,0.08388445190013144,0.06981467738067869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850655488719775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.224310625022276,0.0,0.0,0.112155312511138,0.0,0.0,0.08992387526521717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825917693095112,0.0,0.0,0.09964525739958313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10459240414306605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11778058748031832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09163840479337113,0.0,0.07942360162139236,0.0,0.0,0.06731166290110255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157893422656157,0.08910106404409132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07500842654305429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388445190013144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12219576255865638,0.42962275549869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391885490462075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112155312511138,0.0,0.0,0.10327928715406083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11778058748031832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10201978198086663
Automatic Generation of Input Data for Distribution System Simulation Programs,"Computers have become quite fast, and therefore, the most time-consuming process in distribution system simulations is, in fact, the preparation of input data cases for the simulation programs. Considering this fact, we have developed a computer system which automatically generates input data cases for various distribution system simulation programs from a distribution facility database owned by a utility company. The distribution system simulation programs include a voltage analysis program, an electromagnetic transient analysis program, a harmonics analysis program, a lightning outage risk assessment program and an earthquake and storm (typhoon) risk assessment program. The planning, operation and troubleshooting of a distribution system nowadays are highly dependent on these simulation programs. Using the developed system, a distribution engineer can automatically prepare a simulation data case by specifying a feeder, a transformer bank or an area to be analyzed, and then she/he is readily able to start the simulation. The developed system is also effective to avoid human errors in the data preparation process.",Distributed Systems,automat gener input data distribut system simul program,comput becom quit fast therefor timeconsum process distribut system simul fact prepar input data case simul program consid fact develop comput system automat gener input data case variou distribut system simul program distribut facil databas own util compani distribut system simul program includ voltag analysi program electromagnet transient analysi program harmon analysi program lightn outag risk assess program earthquak storm typhoon risk assess program plan oper troubleshoot distribut system nowaday highli depend simul program use develop system distribut engin automat prepar simul data case specifi feeder transform bank area analyz shehe readili abl start simul develop system also effect avoid human error data prepar process,automat gener input data distribut system simul program comput becom quit fast therefor timeconsum process distribut system simul fact prepar input data case simul program consid fact develop comput system automat gener input data case variou distribut system simul program distribut facil databas own util compani distribut system simul program includ voltag analysi program electromagnet transient analysi program harmon analysi program lightn outag risk assess program earthquak storm typhoon risk assess program plan oper troubleshoot distribut system nowaday highli depend simul program use develop system distribut engin automat prepar simul data case specifi feeder transform bank area analyz shehe readili abl start simul develop system also effect avoid human error data prepar process,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0410680973872536,0.0,0.14257781730329863,0.05371425883383351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050987437425436336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12452310018703806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20940957666600604,0.0,0.0,0.06077275748424831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867846502805571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06980319222200203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09576047022054966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055783053210317256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1959147160714627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10550227220280249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29645954299862104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041827385591062576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046501828451663264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07100360730134654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07366527985822179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08314166020312957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05691066984802854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04788023511027483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23031744652014985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04617261670535052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387995979940982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413406087743965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6007078821052655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13522486067801906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41132033568636345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24555774643963724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061502261889710065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761243033900953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0284252428974063,0.0,0.05421028764535326,0.0,0.0,0.05323111535576532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06980319222200203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
An Updated Review on Distribution Management Systems within a Smart Grid Structure,"A distribution management system is known as the core part of the operation process of an electrical power distribution grid. This system integrates all the aspects needed to have a reliable and consistent control of a distribution system. A typical distribution management system consists of some major components that in this paper are introduced as the operation, planning, power market, and ancillary sections. These subsystems interact with each other to implement all the tasks needed to manage the distribution system. Within an advanced distribution management system, the operation process of the whole system is structured to work under an almost real-time scale; the automation performance level of such system is enhanced meaningfully, and it uses the advanced version of analysis and optimization functions as well as applications.",Distributed Systems,updat review distribut manag system within smart grid structur,distribut manag system known core part oper process electr power distribut grid system integr aspect need reliabl consist control distribut system typic distribut manag system consist major compon paper introduc oper plan power market ancillari section subsystem interact implement task need manag distribut system within advanc distribut manag system oper process whole system structur work almost realtim scale autom perform level system enhanc meaning use advanc version analysi optim function well applic,updat review distribut manag system within smart grid structur distribut manag system known core part oper process electr power distribut grid system integr aspect need reliabl consist control distribut system typic distribut manag system consist major compon paper introduc oper plan power market ancillari section subsystem interact implement task need manag distribut system within advanc distribut manag system oper process whole system structur work almost realtim scale autom perform level system enhanc meaning use advanc version analysi optim function well applic,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16390788409708568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06982296297424084,0.0,0.0,0.0618330970736414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10431529260459699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09933312859145332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255169699293545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20179010712681197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07553665722440406,0.0,0.0,0.10089505356340599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.435544969455936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09035634510287748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07751290953304331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361058547807229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19571134862639553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07141523358801433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07553665722440406,0.0,0.09512076893885923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08116182143713974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0872594973821687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09933312859145332,0.0,0.39102375112006527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14283046717602865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20350416852048586,0.0,0.0768381530862383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04594268705801998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06831838586730556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938495514708723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450614910397993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10891441359558171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255169699293545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537418108973382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537418108973382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10822570169704886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11041296854962596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18294371406952561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4058576428415731,0.0,0.0,0.08447815827082666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255169699293545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04176108289280462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08195394204854284,0.0,0.0,0.19024153787771847,0.0,0.06982296297424084,0.0
Comparative Multi-objective Investigation of Radial and Ring Distribution System in the Presence of DGs,"Power distribution systems must have the potential to satisfy the needs of their customers, such as high reliability, low power loss, acceptable voltage profile, and exploitation of Distributed Generators (DGs). The distribution grids, generally, are operated in a radial mode in rural areas. Hence, there is one current direction in the radial systems; however, DGs lead to a bi-directional current. Additionally, the radial system has another limitation regarding the reliability of the system. Therefore, there is a need to change radial ones into ring distribution systems to optimize DGs’ integrated capacity. In this paper, a redial distribution system is introduced, and afterward, the optimal ring distribution system by utilizing closed Circuit Breakers (CBs), which had been normally open, is implemented. The proposed method is effectively have been tested, and it enables ring distributed systems in the presence of DGs to have high reliability, low power loss, and acceptable voltage profile. The radial IEEE 33-bus system and a real 41 bus system have been evaluated, and in some cases, the benchmark system converted to a ring system with connecting DGs.

A primary and secondary equipment integrated intelligent distribution system breaker to better locate and isolate faults,"As electrification deepens and the society relies more and more on electricity, dependability and safety standard of the power distribution system becomes higher and higher. What’s more, to minimize carbon emission, high percentage of renewable energy resources penetration is becoming a reality, which further complicates the distribution system. Because of equipment failure, animal intrusion and other causes, power system faults are inevitable. Fault section identification, location and isolation is a critical mission in distribution system operation [1]. As the distribution system develops and evolves, two main ways to accomplish this goal were established in distribution system: a) Substation overcurrent relay detects the fault and the corresponding substation breaker isolates the fault Then trial-and-error method is used to identify and isolate the fault section; b) Distributed sensors are deployed in the distribution system. Distribution system automation software in the operation center then collects fault information sent from all the distributed sensors. Operation stuff make a judgement on the fault section and fault isolation is done on a remote control or manual operation fashion.These methods leave a lot of room for improvements, which will be elaborated in the paper. A primary and secondary equipment integrated intelligent distribution system breaker is proposed, depending on which the shortcomings of the aforementioned methods can be overcome. This integrated breaker acquires and analyzes traveling wave signals and fundamental frequency signals, and then locate and isolate faults based on fault analysis results under various scenarios, including renewable energy resources integration. With this breaker, fault location accuracy and fault isolation selectivity and speed can be improved, which helps with distribution system reliability, safety, and economic operation.",Distributed

Situational Awareness of De-energized Lines During Loss of SCADA Communication in Electric Power Distribution Systems,"With the electric power distribution grid facing ever increasing complexity and new threats from cyber-attacks, situational awareness for system operators is quickly becoming indispensable. Identifying de-energized lines on the distribution system during a SCADA communication failure is a prime example where operators need to act quickly to deal with an emergent loss of service. Loss of cellular towers, poor signal strength, and even cyber-attacks can impact SCADA visibility of line devices on the distribution system. Neural Networks (NNs) provide a unique approach to learn the characteristics of normal system behavior, identify when abnormal conditions occur, and flag these conditions for system operators. This study applies a 24-hour load forecast for distribution line devices given the weather forecast and day of the week, then determines the current state of distribution devices based on changes in SCADA analogs from communicating line devices. A neural network-based algorithm is applied to historical events on Alabama Power's distribution system to identify de-energized sections of line when a significant amount of SCADA information is hidden.",Distributed Systems,situat awar deenerg line loss scada commun electr power distribut system,electr power distribut grid face ever increas complex new threat cyberattack situat awar system oper quickli becom indispens identifi deenerg line distribut system scada commun failur prime exampl oper need act quickli deal emerg loss servic loss cellular tower poor signal strength even cyberattack impact scada visibl line devic distribut system neural network nn provid uniqu approach learn characterist normal system behavior identifi abnorm condit occur flag condit system oper studi appli 24hour load forecast distribut line devic given weather forecast day week determin current state distribut devic base chang scada analog commun line devic neural networkbas algorithm appli histor event alabama power distribut system identifi deenerg section line signific amount scada inform hidden,situat awar deenerg line loss scada commun electr power distribut system electr power distribut grid face ever increas complex new threat cyberattack situat awar system oper quickli becom indispens identifi deenerg line distribut system scada commun failur prime exampl oper need act quickli deal emerg loss servic loss cellular tower poor signal strength even cyberattack impact scada visibl line devic distribut system neural network nn provid uniqu approach learn characterist normal system behavior identifi abnorm condit occur flag condit system oper studi appli 24hour load forecast distribut line devic given weather forecast day week determin current state distribut devic base chang scada analog commun line devic neural networkbas algorithm appli histor event alabama power distribut system identifi deenerg section line signific amount scada inform hidden,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05974502433937056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12588040754515992,0.0,0.05448896851764228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04274169893070939,0.0712110680278223,0.08806251334633992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08319916553181737,0.07586585248296708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1822767430332707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06668562938101512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06601497016615185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692921970503609,0.0,0.29940784991165625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34737934492183814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14413174378102706,0.06737758288651764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0847028447947293,0.08631800616636581,0.0,0.0,0.0847028447947293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738831494377105,0.0,0.08806251334633992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07804714191112348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807382223032673,0.0,0.0,0.06601497016615185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056527341337062775,0.0,0.06075891434442357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051240782074756235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5397534036987455,0.0,0.0,0.07295557520779641,0.0,0.0,0.2495974965954521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056958933751970024,0.046177175227394,0.160942543574737,0.05528159058427197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16230963438245322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735459112077587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05025739551028149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07485196247791406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0847028447947293,0.06473255884166325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17263601233273163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08179256751955864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04671534342794906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25176783721108176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806251334633992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"Integrated Distribution Management System: Architecture, Functions, and Application in China","As massive distributed energy resources (DERs) are integrated into distribution networks (DNs) and the distribution automation facilities are widely deployed, the DNs are evolving to active distribution networks (ADNs). This paper introduces the architecture and main function modules of an integrated distribution management system (IDMS) and its applications in China. This system consists of three subsystems, including the real-time operation and control system (OCS), outage management system (OMS), and operator training simulator (OTS). The OCS has a hierarchical architecture with three levels, including the local controller for DER clusters, the optimization of DNs incorporated with multi-clusters, and the coordination operation of integrated transmission & distribution (T&D) networks. The OMS is developed based on the geographical information system (GIS) and coordinated with OCS. While in the OTS, both the ADN and its host transmission network (TN) are simulated to make the simulation results more credible. The main functions of the three subsystems and their interaction data flows are described and some typical application scenarios are also presented.",Distributed Systems,integr distribut manag system architectur function applic china,massiv distribut energi resourc der integr distribut network dn distribut autom facil wide deploy dn evolv activ distribut network adn paper introduc architectur main function modul integr distribut manag system idm applic china system consist three subsystem includ realtim oper control system oc outag manag system om oper train simul ot oc hierarch architectur three level includ local control der cluster optim dn incorpor multiclust coordin oper integr transmiss distribut td network om develop base geograph inform system gi coordin oc ot adn host transmiss network tn simul make simul result credibl main function three subsystem interact data flow describ typic applic scenario also present,integr distribut manag system architectur function applic china massiv distribut energi resourc der integr distribut network dn distribut autom facil wide deploy dn evolv activ distribut network adn paper introduc architectur main function modul integr distribut manag system idm applic china system consist three subsystem includ realtim oper control system oc outag manag system om oper train simul ot oc hierarch architectur three level includ local control der cluster optim dn incorpor multiclust coordin oper integr transmiss distribut td network om develop base geograph inform system gi coordin oc ot adn host transmiss network tn simul make simul result credibl main function three subsystem interact data flow describ typic applic scenario also present,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08111186103023234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0548125499968362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685194802374784,0.0,0.0,0.2524663615770823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09024059925198306,0.0,0.0,0.0486842683290359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09165955229870883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13724470999916438,0.0,0.20966471228456451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05229648244243221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08415545385902742,0.09831918428519476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046937070685032264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3956770475491904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08111186103023234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09647945981053312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08889838481327807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278716912778154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278090755505398,0.09316455368090089,0.0,0.0,0.06920649771363056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27448941999832877,0.0,0.086413820968593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07373261576198964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07927213655557068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024662885604207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.172827641937186,0.0,0.0,0.0744522290437464,0.2131386665648766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10030623809392318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21038957698821137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1848762681491265,0.0,0.06980471750201528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04173729016845609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05415922492516567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09316455368090089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07373261576198964,0.0,0.048944217509772146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08309891483896076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20586706499874657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458047811464455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.259241462905779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08017496041004293,0.0,0.0,0.18331910459741765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09316455368090089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08208551209373875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Reliability Analysis of Electricity Distribution Networks with Sampling Method; A Case Study of Sistan and Baluchestan Network,"Finding the causes of outages and the most suitable solution for reducing them, in an economically optimal way, has always been one of the main challenges for electricity distribution companies. However, due to the variety of climate conditions, diversity in the structure, equipment, and facilities of each distribution network, as well as the difference in preventive and maintenance programs, there is no single solution to improve the reliability of distribution networks. This paper presents a novel approach based on sampling procedure to fast analyze system reliability with limited data. Considering the poor state of reliability of the distribution network of Sistan and Baluchestan province at the country scope, as well as the implementation of training and evaluation plans of distribution companies of Iran in this field, in this research, the reliability situation of the distribution network of the province is analyzed with proposed method in order to identify vulnerable areas, and then proposing a solution for improving reliability. For this purpose, the feeders of the selected cities have been determined by a two-step non-random sampling method. and then the causes of errors in the critical feeders are scrutinized. then the available solutions to improve the reliability situation for the selected city have been presented.",Distributed Systems,reliabl analysi electr distribut network sampl method case studi sistan baluchestan network,find caus outag suitabl solut reduc econom optim way alway one main challeng electr distribut compani howev due varieti climat condit divers structur equip facil distribut network well differ prevent mainten program singl solut improv reliabl distribut network paper present novel approach base sampl procedur fast analyz system reliabl limit data consid poor state reliabl distribut network sistan baluchestan provinc countri scope well implement train evalu plan distribut compani iran field research reliabl situat distribut network provinc analyz propos method order identifi vulner area propos solut improv reliabl purpos feeder select citi determin twostep nonrandom sampl method caus error critic feeder scrutin avail solut improv reliabl situat select citi present,reliabl analysi electr distribut network sampl method case studi sistan baluchestan network find caus outag suitabl solut reduc econom optim way alway one main challeng electr distribut compani howev due varieti climat condit divers structur equip facil distribut network well differ prevent mainten program singl solut improv reliabl distribut network paper present novel approach base sampl procedur fast analyz system reliabl limit data consid poor state reliabl distribut network sistan baluchestan provinc countri scope well implement train evalu plan distribut compani iran field research reliabl situat distribut network provinc analyz propos method order identifi vulner area propos solut improv reliabl purpos feeder select citi determin twostep nonrandom sampl method caus error critic feeder scrutin avail solut improv reliabl situat select citi present,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05680096143362712,0.128393950847185,0.0,0.0,0.05557698836539055,0.0,0.0,0.060937995578391024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07350486222369952,0.0435951527219669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07441233087760274,0.15476143944296267,0.051924548778845954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16685155535429563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.066669509618925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07441233087760274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0468297710359087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07846531995042368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05126092054110706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35431571447066484,0.08080747315587561,0.0,0.0,0.06602511971648434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14700972444739904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804157896434704,0.08486046222869653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05765606281937992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804157896434704,0.0,0.0,0.0641969754235925,0.0,0.07098557744320846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051924548778845954,0.0,0.0,0.06144905015576841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0580962731458816,0.0,0.15090362307443225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06733313785666388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07738071972148133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14378330040929668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28259536565041116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634658465620894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06305673087260574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06250781668621978,0.07441233087760274,0.0,0.0,0.037374363455508534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634658465620894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09699559068890337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07179402635633053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08812633559774467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06733313785666388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4861631120561502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046040461077950484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25458138668608954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15921112900282086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08982091995542067,0.17608315792869408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2748918353233058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08342577767714782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07441233087760274,0.0,0.047648141794787824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03668500914725619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07179402635633053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08342577767714782,0.0,0.07535842663948673,0.13333901923785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Smart Planning of Distribution Network Using AMI System,"With recent developments in the field of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), more electrical data of distribution network is now available. This valuable data can be beneficial for distribution utilities in planning for future development and optimization of network. As a new experience, this paper deals with employing real-time and hourly AMI data to improve distribution planning.

A Study on Meshed Distribution System and Protection Coordination Using HILS System,"Most distribution networks are composed of radial distribution systems, but to solve problems, such as reliability, utilization rate, power loss, and hosting capacity of distributed generators (DGs), research has recently been conducted on introducing the mesh distribution system. Although the meshed distribution system has various advantages, it makes the structure of the distribution system and the protection coordination method more complicated by its complex structure and bi-direction power flow. Therefore, to solve this problem and promote the introduction of a mesh distribution network, this paper explains the need for hard-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) for real-time protection cooperative research.",Distributed Systems,studi mesh distribut system protect coordin use hil system,distribut network compos radial distribut system solv problem reliabl util rate power loss host capac distribut gener dg research recent conduct introduc mesh distribut system although mesh distribut system variou advantag make structur distribut system protect coordin method complic complex structur bidirect power flow therefor solv problem promot introduct mesh distribut network paper explain need hardintheloop simul hil realtim protect cooper research,studi mesh distribut system protect coordin use hil system distribut network compos radial distribut system solv problem reliabl util rate power loss host capac distribut gener dg research recent conduct introduc mesh distribut system although mesh distribut system variou advantag make structur distribut system protect coordin method complic complex structur bidirect power flow therefor solv problem promot introduct mesh distribut network paper explain need hardintheloop simul hil realtim protect cooper research,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099902794011621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10180779654367492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865238424673793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08118286217664038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21710414428112135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11772067642936862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46824761787562574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10855207214056067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09205272338182321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05745223015886534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634883465220085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981292790839195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07709398162541727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5284241259999234,0.05542177217719528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06718023036339289,0.10892736450495066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0432182343318562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364591823801935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14211449793725184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2943878372517585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11126044538669848,0.0,0.0,0.09647026666448556,0.0,0.0,0.09647026666448556,0.0,0.0,0.07786137504796956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08031139666617186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10647873310175657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105724896862592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.196258558167839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17209494721568877,0.0,0.055098424887317775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25452655379880107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08499811278114051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039284603970464536,0.0,0.0749203688059598,0.0,0.0,0.0735671210692861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Mathematical Model of a Ship Power System with DC Power Distribution System,"The power of the energy systems of modern ships and marine offshore platforms is increasing. In order to achieve greater reliability and ensure sustainable operation of the ship's power plant, a direct current distribution network is used. Such ship energy systems have a number of advantages, but there are problems with the distribution of power between parallel gener-ators, with the quality of power on the AC and DC side.

A Probabilistic Convolution-Based Model for the Equivalent Reliability of the Distribution System,"In traditional reliability assessment of power transmission systems, the distribution network is often equivalenced with a constant load, which is no longer able to meet the reliability evaluation requirements of modern power systems. Hence, this paper suggests a precise alternative model for evaluating the reliability of power transmission systems' distribution networks, employing probabilistic convolution. The continuous load curve of the distribution network undergoes discretization, transforming into a discrete probability model of load demand. Furthermore, using the sequential Monte Carlo approach, a discrete probability distribution model is developed for the distribution network's failure intensity. By utilizing the theory of probabilistic convolution, the problem of solving the precise equivalent model of the distribution network is transformed into determining the joint probability density distribution and expectation of independent distributed two-dimensional discrete random variables. This approach accurately reflects the impact of variations in both the distribution network's load level and reliability level on the power transmission system. As a result, it achieves the precise equivalent of the distribution network's load level in reliability assessment. The efficacy of the suggested approach is showcased by evaluating and analyzing the RBTS test system, particularly its distribution system at BUS4.",Distributed Systems,probabilist convolutionbas model equival reliabl distribut system,tradit reliabl assess power transmiss system distribut network often equivalenc constant load longer abl meet reliabl evalu requir modern power system henc paper suggest precis altern model evalu reliabl power transmiss system distribut network employ probabilist convolut continu load curv distribut network undergo discret transform discret probabl model load demand furthermor use sequenti mont carlo approach discret probabl distribut model develop distribut network failur intens util theori probabilist convolut problem solv precis equival model distribut network transform determin joint probabl densiti distribut expect independ distribut twodimension discret random variabl approach accur reflect impact variat distribut network load level reliabl level power transmiss system result achiev precis equival distribut network load level reliabl assess efficaci suggest approach showcas evalu analyz rbt test system particularli distribut system bus4,probabilist convolutionbas model equival reliabl distribut system tradit reliabl assess power transmiss system distribut network often equivalenc constant load longer abl meet reliabl evalu requir modern power system henc paper suggest precis altern model evalu reliabl power transmiss system distribut network employ probabilist convolut continu load curv distribut network undergo discret transform discret probabl model load demand furthermor use sequenti mont carlo approach discret probabl distribut model develop distribut network failur intens util theori probabilist convolut problem solv precis equival model distribut network transform determin joint probabl densiti distribut expect independ distribut twodimension discret random variabl approach accur reflect impact variat distribut network load level reliabl level power transmiss system result achiev precis equival distribut network load level reliabl assess efficaci suggest approach showcas evalu analyz rbt test system particularli distribut system bus4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05420173275063174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05566643485206755,0.0,0.0,0.14457563374453755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12904873295529984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07491404712618253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788545108331826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06803879142819695,0.036445539104061016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5266868328253701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06803879142819695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14998405035055093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634255021134334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788545108331826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05838586175051783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18465888756154258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3226218323882496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07491404712618253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.211526751231996,0.07491404712618253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28588453701474376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0711715015191307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03240803098130031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20465312748792627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053283655883271074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36133834778950946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04686197335924989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038004041733667525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735841425705866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14013943524007913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22267195000824422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05618049119614989,0.0,0.0,0.07788545108331826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07006971762003956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14013943524007913,0.21351450455739207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02945832198481319,0.0,0.05618049119614989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Preliminary Design of Solid State Transformer Application for Power Distribution System in Indonesia,"Power converters are widely used in power systems such as inverters for solar power generation or rectifiers in electric vehicle battery chargers. In addition, AC-AC converters are also used in wind power plants to stabilize the power output. Solid state transformer (SST) is a power transformer consisting of a high frequency transformer, power converter and control circuit, which is designed to provide a high level of control flexibility. In the future, this control flexibility can be developed so that SST has the ability to solve the above problems. This study project the potential application of SST for power distribution system at PT. PLN (Persero) and designed the SST topology based on the expected functions according to the available literature. The SST topology is selected based on the capability to perform the expected functions and the switching components are selected based on their commercially available ratings. Based on these considerations, a three-stage SST configuration with h-bridge module and dual active bridge was chosen using the highest voltage rating available of IGBT. The output of this study is potential application of SST at power distribution system along with its preliminary design.",Distributed Systems,preliminari design solid state transform applic power distribut system indonesia,power convert wide use power system invert solar power gener rectifi electr vehicl batteri charger addit acac convert also use wind power plant stabil power output solid state transform sst power transform consist high frequenc transform power convert control circuit design provid high level control flexibl futur control flexibl develop sst abil solv problem studi project potenti applic sst power distribut system pt pln persero design sst topolog base expect function accord avail literatur sst topolog select base capabl perform expect function switch compon select base commerci avail rate base consider threestag sst configur hbridg modul dual activ bridg chosen use highest voltag rate avail igbt output studi potenti applic sst power distribut system along preliminari design,preliminari design solid state transform applic power distribut system indonesia power convert wide use power system invert solar power gener rectifi electr vehicl batteri charger addit acac convert also use wind power plant stabil power output solid state transform sst power transform consist high frequenc transform power convert control circuit design provid high level control flexibl futur control flexibl develop sst abil solv problem studi project potenti applic sst power distribut system pt pln persero design sst topolog base expect function accord avail literatur sst topolog select base capabl perform expect function switch compon select base commerci avail rate base consider threestag sst configur hbridg modul dual activ bridg chosen use highest voltag rate avail igbt output studi potenti applic sst power distribut system along preliminari design,0.07530905932028911,0.0,0.0,0.0817312640417698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06871281145023053,0.0,0.06791912881436198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817312640417698,0.04643370729263801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14275898893421723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20861288017508578,0.16496886683631265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06434613614146874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892308633548174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09630821423578279,0.0,0.0,0.07892308633548174,0.07764814485474868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17439748812813927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20040150148400648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0397621019545423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436539015455517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06953762672502858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16657952328848707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16657952328848707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08880730672426816,0.12869227228293748,0.06129294486272715,0.0,0.0,0.04700212280706124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13430862769551358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715431384775679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715431384775679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08497306729111714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16657952328848707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052577363653743804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12492316808506046,0.5581916690309116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058132496042713096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06434613614146874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04849424446672269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15784617267096349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15061811864057822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08028033748589058,0.0,0.09102304824675256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15784617267096349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09015291228445835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13882012129878765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634625280835396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30578439221095827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09641713342410345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644609805273957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892308633548174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06953762672502858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A Review On The Connotation And Supporting Requirements Of Virtual Inertia In Active Distribution Systems,"The active distribution network has poor disturbance resistance, and the network security boundary is difficult to characterize and evaluate. It is necessary to characterize the virtual inertia, and the distributed source load support ability in the distribution network is limited and difficult to coordinate control under various disturbances. It is urgent to establish a virtual inertia adaptive allocation and collaborative control method for the self governance area of the distribution network. This article first introduces the connotation of virtual inertia, and based on this, proposes the support capacity of virtual inertia in distribution systems and the evaluation of system inertia requirements.

The Real-time Digital Simulation System for Distribution Network,"With the access of large-scale distributed power and electric vehicles, the operation state of modern distribution network is more complex and changeable. In this paper, kinds of operation scenarios that may occur in the field operation of the system are fully considered. Combined with the wide area measurement and control system function of the distribution network, the test scheme is designed based on the actual distribution network and a typical test case is established. The typical network parameters of the actual distribution network are calculated and a typical 28-nodes distribution network simulation example is established. The artificial short circuit test based on unmanned aerial vehicle is carried out to verify the correctness of the simulation example. The test results verify the correctness of the proposed example. Based on the real-time digital simulation system and dynamic simulation experiment system, the test platform of wide area measurement and control system in distribution network is built. Through the multi scene real-time digital simulation test, the state estimation, fault diagnosis and positioning, coordinated control and other advanced application control effects can be checked. Through the hardware in the loop test and dynamic simulation experiment based on real-time digital simulation, the distribution network Phasor Measurement Unit (DPMU) and master station of distribution network wide area measurement control system can be tested.",Distributed Systems,realtim digit simul system distribut network,access largescal distribut power electr vehicl oper state

An On-line Electric Power Distribution System Simulator,"The modern power system is currently undergoing a rapid transformation from centralized generation to decentralized and distributed generation. The distributed generation is connected at the distribution level and may consist of a large number of small generators with stochastic power output. Therefore, planning and operation of the future distribution grid requires new tools to ensure reliable and economical operation. One such tool is an on-line simulator. A system that uses an on-line simulator in the Energy Control Center (ECC) will enhance the operators' situational awareness as well as operational decision making.

Surge Arrester Placement in Wind Turbine System by Evaluation Overvoltages of Direct Lightning Strike to the Wind Turbine Blades and Overhead Distribution Lines,"With the increasing use of renewable energy, the design of lightning protection system in generating electricity from wind energy is an important issue. Most wind turbines are installed in areas with high lightning density, high altitudes and rocky areas. Therefore, wind turbines are strongly affected by the direct impact of lightning on the wind turbine blades and even on the adjacent ground. On the other hand, the ground system is one of the most important components required in a lightning protection system suitable for wind turbines that proper design with an effective surge arrester is essential for the safety of people and equipment and the reduction of transient overvoltages on wind turbine electronic equipment. In this paper, using the real parameters of a 100 kW wind turbine, transient overvoltages against direct lightning strike to WT blades and overhead distribution line simulated. wind turbine equipment, grounding system, and a selected arrester are modelled in EMTP-RV environment for analyzing overvoltages in differenct scenarios.",Distributed Systems,surg arrest placement wind turbin system evalu overvoltag direct lightn strike wind turbin blade overhead distribut line,increas use renew energi design lightn protect system gener electr wind energi import issu wind turbin instal area high lightn densiti high altitud rocki area therefor wind turbin strongli affect direct impact lightn wind turbin blade even adjac ground hand ground system one import compon requir lightn protect system suitabl wind turbin proper design effect surg arrest essenti safeti peopl equip reduct transient overvoltag wind turbin electron equip paper use real paramet 100 kw wind turbin transient overvoltag direct lightn strike wt blade overhead distribut line simul wind turbin equip ground system select arrest model emtprv environ analyz overvoltag differenct scenario,surg arrest placement wind turbin system evalu overvoltag direct lightn strike wind turbin blade overhead distribut line increas use renew energi design lightn protect system gener electr wind energi import issu wind turbin instal area high lightn densiti high altitud rocki area therefor wind turbin strongli affect direct impact lightn wind turbin blade even adjac ground hand ground system one import compon requir lightn protect system suitabl wind turbin proper design effect surg arrest essenti safeti peopl equip reduct transient overvoltag wind turbin electron equip paper use real paramet 100 kw wind turbin transient overvoltag direct lightn strike wt blade overhead distribut line simul wind turbin equip ground system select arrest model emtprv environ analyz overvoltag differenct scenario,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128847536268978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991494757323168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18823224221729531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128847536268978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16358483258661935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365356149850694,0.0,0.1563501222011833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07720786701044645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11352510776664478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22435707665671292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11217853832835646,0.40792933028519385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0890473166938359,0.13343208555184122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07673429923101112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21926836090359944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10399314412944412,0.0,0.18668911571864266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0890473166938359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061396630275814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2834238626174612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535157063227531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09738841691776991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057723101719226774,0.12480367721052943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2621266900772157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1195112034725962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08346753483852487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13597644342839796,0.0,0.0,0.11492665418973295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12294738083235829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490542298904352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28329211775053376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11352510776664478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10493853930146298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Aggregated Model of a Flexible Multi-Energy Distribution System for Coordinated TSO-DSO Fast Frequency Services Provision,"The massive penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) encourages the provision of frequency regulation services at the distribution network level following large frequency disturbances occurring at the transmission system side. The availability of reduced-order or aggregated models will facilitate the coordination between transmission and distribution system operators. As there are no models that can capture the dynamics of diverse distributed technologies and their control systems by a unified single device model, this paper presents the single equivalent device based on the virtual synchronous machine (VSM) technology that can subsume the frequency response of different DER and loads. The validation of the proposed model is performed on the adjusted IEEE 9-bus system for different multi-energy systems. Simulated scenarios have demonstrated the accuracy of proposed aggregation with a maximum relative error of 0.1% as well as computational improvement of almost 100%.",Distributed Systems,aggreg model flexibl multienergi distribut system coordin tsodso fast frequenc servic provis,massiv penetr distribut energi resourc der encourag provis frequenc regul servic distribut network level follow larg frequenc disturb occur transmiss system side avail reducedord aggreg model facilit coordin transmiss distribut system oper model captur dynam divers distribut technolog control system unifi singl devic model paper present singl equival devic base virtual synchron machin vsm technolog subsum frequenc respons differ der load valid propos model perform adjust ieee 9bu system differ multienergi system simul scenario demonstr accuraci propos aggreg maximum rel error 01 well comput improv almost 100,aggreg model flexibl multienergi distribut system coordin tsodso fast frequenc servic provis massiv penetr distribut energi resourc der encourag provis frequenc regul servic distribut network level follow larg frequenc disturb occur transmiss system side avail reducedord aggreg model facilit coordin transmiss distribut system oper model captur dynam divers distribut technolog control system unifi singl devic model paper present singl equival devic base virtual synchron machin vsm technolog subsum frequenc respons differ der load valid propos model perform adjust ieee 9bu system differ multienergi system simul scenario demonstr accuraci propos aggreg maximum rel error 01 well comput improv almost 100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846857557927168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3457050188907818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857023071964713,0.05082936091335817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265125623257165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06672025535286194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07164594577912238,0.0,0.21890281393325345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07773269170426363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17803117382072162,0.0,0.0,0.11953438252881754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2950793543978607,0.0942167181689182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09569819214411847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846857557927168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09894226290262219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265125623257165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265125623257165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378056278665069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10472586223292273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05864822303603433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07773269170426363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08276497064972753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08676036179306787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846857557927168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2844218156276992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054914904281125526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06434071950139016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04357628980227959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06479947020987267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05654555126316109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10275007743721899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523500629692726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07698137131942699,0.09022132702557786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08676036179306787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17803117382072162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07164594577912238,0.20945172446584545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.256635261532113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11657143457841698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19139638428823694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972695058570724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698108735021565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07773269170426363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
A Test Bed to Evaluate Advanced Distribution Management Systems for Modern Power Systems,"This paper presents a test bed that utilities, vendors, and researchers can use to evaluate the performance of existing and emerging advanced distribution management systems (ADMS) or specific applications of such systems. The test bed provides a realistic laboratory test setting, including detailed modeling of the power system, controller and/or power hardware, and industry-standard communication protocols. The test bed can further represent the current state of a specific utility's distribution system or the anticipated state with increased penetrations of distributed energy resources, such as rooftop photovoltaic systems, residential battery energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and loads with smart controls. The paper describes the design and implementation of the test bed. We present two use cases of the test bed and preliminary results for these two use cases. We also discuss upcoming and potential future use cases. Results from test bed experiments are intended to accelerate industry deployment of ADMS technologies and advance development of ADMS capabilities.",Distributed Systems,test bed evalu advanc distribut manag system modern power system,paper present test bed util vendor research use evalu perform exist emerg advanc distribut manag system adm specif applic system test bed provid realist laboratori test set includ detail model power system control andor power hardwar industrystandard commun protocol test bed repres current state specif util distribut system anticip state increas penetr distribut energi resourc rooftop photovolta system residenti batteri energi storag system electr vehicl load smart control paper describ design implement test bed present two use case test bed preliminari result two use case also discuss upcom potenti futur use case result test bed experi intend acceler industri deploy adm technolog advanc develop adm capabl,test bed evalu advanc distribut manag system modern power system paper present test bed util vendor research use evalu perform exist emerg advanc distribut manag system adm specif applic system test bed provid realist laboratori test set includ detail model power system control andor power hardwar industrystandard commun protocol test bed repres current state specif util distribut system anticip state increas penetr distribut energi resourc rooftop photovolta system residenti batteri energi storag system electr vehicl load smart control paper describ design implement test bed present two use case test bed preliminari result two use case also discuss upcom potenti futur use case result test bed experi intend acceler industri deploy adm technolog advanc develop adm capabl,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21516639054029435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05280262118231944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05411333886938029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07317194446291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24015524845076916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666875528211728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13221206515262396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243605219827938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0810695461313308,0.0947139048094907,0.0569722147132205,0.08974829005248651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04521592888731802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906221231890476,0.21781023562236268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07907550734079272,0.07393120225121486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15627511843982841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12405117922240268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06501881755884605,0.0,0.06844101865101743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969997308934461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06249916175121622,0.0,0.0,0.0615612136303377,0.0,0.06202558961120134,0.06969997308934461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08005174948358973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13688203730203485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052485866729328264,0.09294164144059056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804136396525518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059788950261437566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07102890449516717,0.19042621168203966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10434650595225442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09294164144059056,0.05514578459052162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09294164144059056,0.0,0.049529686986735474,0.0,0.07102890449516717,0.0,0.09429895074696273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07393120225121486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662809507316622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13939994617868923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17949658010497302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662809507316622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157217764770503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05377886332511645,0.5575997847147569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478624045024297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14618912764076644,0.0,0.13939994617868923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693155450426945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Towards the Decentralized Energy Optimization of Active Unbalanced Distribution Systems Integrated with Natural Gas Systems,"This article presents the ADMM-based decentralized multi-period energy optimization of an active unbalanced power distribution system integrated with the natural gas distribution network. The second-order cone programming (SOCP) based relaxations are utilized to convexify the nonconvexities involved in the multi-energy system. The relaxation error in each subsystem problem is iteratively reduced to predefined accepted levels. The power distribution subsystem problem is modeled as a bi-level problem. Level 1 solves the linearized version, and level 2 solves the nonlinear version of the subsystem problem. The sequential bound tightening algorithm and solution recovery procedures are proposed to recover meaningful solutions to the original nonconvex subsystems problem from their relaxed counterparts.

Fault Modeling and Simulation Based on Cyber Physical System in Complex Distribution Network,"With the high penetration of renewable energy in distribution network and the gradual improvement of smart grid construction, the physical processing and information processing are closely coupled. Complex distribution network is a typical cyber physical system(CPS). The sequential property of electric power system and the time-discrete property of communication system have made the research of CPS for distribution network complicated. In view of dynamic process of CPS for distribution network, the fusion modeling and large-scale simulation calculation and platform of CPS for distribution network were investigated. First, the characteristics and the interaction principle of CPS for distribution network were analyzed. And the coupling mode of CPS for distribution network was proposed. Next, the simulation model of physical system was proposed. From different information data types, information data flow was modeled. On this basis, a framework for integration of multiple cyber physical modules was constructed. And CPS fusion method was proposed. Taking the simulation platform of CPS for distribution network as example, characteristics of RT-LAB as the physical simulation tool, and OPNET as the information simulation tool were analyzed. And the feasibility of co-simulation of RT-LAB and OPNET was elaborated. Finally, a fast simulation framework based on RT-LAB was established. And a cooperative simulation for electrical power system and control system was proposed. Based on the essential difference between physical events and information events, two kinds of simulation timing synchronization methods suitable for physical model and information model were presented. A 62-nodes distribution network with distributed generators of an area was modeled on RT-LAB. The simulation results of CPS platform based on RT-LAB and OPNET show that when a single-phase fault occurs in a complex distribution network, communication problems such as congestion delays and error codes of information system in the transmission of measurement data and control instruction cause failures to be dealt with in time delay to trigger a cascading fault. The results effectively verified the importance of control information system to monitor distribution network. At the same time, the CPS simulation platform for the actual environment of complex distribution network is necessary.",Distributed Systems,fault model simul base cyber physic system complex distribut

Considering the Impact of PV-Battery Systems on Long-Term Distribution Network Planning,"In recent decades, distributed generation (DG), more specifically renewable ones, has been widely used in power distribution systems due to different reasons. Photovoltaic (PV) systems are one of the practical resources that can be utilized in different sizes. However, from the peaks shaving standpoint, they could not be lonely effective. In this paper, the impact of the joint implementation of PV and battery systems in long-term planning is considered. These systems are conducted to reduce the total peak of the network which can cause postponement in the requirement of system upgrading. To reach this aim, firstly a sensitivity analyses is performed to determine the required load reduction. Then, through particle swarm optimization (PSO) the best site and size of PV-battery systems are determined. In order to catch the uncertainty of solar irradiance and the load of system, a k-means data crusting method is employed. The proposed method is verified via a real 104-bus test system. Obtained results demonstrate how PV-battery systems can affect on long-term planning by deferring the need of system to upgrade instruments.",Distributed Systems,consid impact pvbatteri system longterm distribut network plan,recent decad distribut gener dg specif renew one wide use power distribut system due differ reason photovolta pv system one practic resourc util differ size howev peak shave standpoint could lone effect paper impact joint implement pv batteri system longterm plan consid system conduct reduc total peak network caus postpon requir system upgrad reach aim firstli sensit analys perform determin requir load reduct particl swarm optim pso best site size pvbatteri system determin order catch uncertainti solar irradi load system kmean data crust method employ propos method verifi via real 104bu test system obtain result demonstr pvbatteri system affect longterm plan defer need system upgrad instrument,consid impact pvbatteri system longterm distribut network plan recent decad distribut gener dg specif renew one wide use power distribut system due differ reason photovolta pv system one practic resourc util differ size howev peak shave standpoint could lone effect paper impact joint implement pv batteri system longterm plan consid system conduct reduc total peak network caus postpon requir system upgrad reach aim firstli sensit analys perform determin requir load reduct particl swarm optim pso best site size pvbatteri system determin order catch uncertainti solar irradi load system kmean data crust method employ propos method verifi via real 104bu test system obtain result demonstr pvbatteri system affect longterm plan defer need system upgrad instrument,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049629141848241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08502800815404932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10871130920430792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248969556634799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09298621748869801,0.0,0.0,0.17660569115912395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11239651131112771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06202538557650137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08830284557956197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20785246720837983,0.0,0.0,0.13483634510890208,0.0,0.13578876390963202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20112268926111518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08744936004511769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06621145595812016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10392623360418991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06580533656400421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06877334839891086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17836362404731365,0.07694771216515145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19711621100134852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12695933163983994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07694771216515145,0.12476455417757468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09102261072708506,0.0,0.0,0.1670355399588879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827907407135333,0.09855810550067426,0.0,0.0,0.049501828702657395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07361095423466422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033599938243949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0781496418759283,0.07579292928472665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058361057762837794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248969556634799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11442788148415614,0.08918181202365683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918181202365683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431591681232716,0.0,0.0,0.08744936004511769,0.0,0.05804948671501087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2430569231324218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08581320640021742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5344766727645142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08581320640021742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044996279150725495,0.0,0.08581320640021742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248969556634799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973561757898974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Optimal Energy Flow of Unbalanced Power Distribution System Integrated with District Heating System,"This paper presents the decentralized 15-minute time interval multi-period energy optimization of an active Unbalanced three-phase Power Distribution System (UPDS) interconnected with the District Heating System (DHS). The UPDS subsystem problem is formulated as a bi-level problem, where level-1 solves the linear three-phase power flow approximation, and level-2 solves the nonlinear convex versions of the subsystem problem. The variable mass flow rate in DHS brings increased system flexibility compared to the constant flow rate and, therefore, enhances energy optimization of the heating system. The McCormick envelopes based polyhedral relaxations and the Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) relaxations are employed to convexify the nonconvexities involved in the integrated UPDS-DHS system. The relaxation error in each subsystem problem is iteratively reduced below predefined acceptance levels. The proposed approach minimizes the integrated system's multi-period operation cost and is implemented on an active unbalanced IEEE-13 bus distribution network and a 30-node DHS.",Distributed Systems,optim energi flow unbalanc power distribut system integr district heat system,paper present decentr 15minut time interv multiperiod energi optim activ unbalanc threephas power distribut system upd interconnect district heat system dh upd subsystem problem formul bilevel problem level1 solv linear threephas power flow approxim level2 solv nonlinear convex version subsystem problem variabl mass flow rate dh bring increas system flexibl compar constant flow rate therefor enhanc energi optim heat system mccormick envelop base polyhedr relax second order cone program socp relax employ convexifi nonconvex involv integr updsdh system relax error subsystem problem iter reduc predefin accept level propos approach minim integr system multiperiod oper cost implement activ unbalanc ieee13 bu distribut network 30node dh,optim energi flow unbalanc power distribut system integr district heat system paper present decentr 15minut time interv multiperiod energi optim activ unbalanc threephas power distribut system upd interconnect district heat system dh upd subsystem problem formul bilevel problem level1 solv linear threephas power flow approxim level2 solv nonlinear convex version subsystem problem variabl mass flow rate dh bring increas system flexibl compar constant flow rate therefor enhanc energi optim heat system mccormick envelop base polyhedr relax second order cone program socp relax employ convexifi nonconvex involv integr updsdh system relax error subsystem problem iter reduc predefin accept level propos approach minim integr system multiperiod oper cost implement activ unbalanc ieee13 bu distribut network 30node dh,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18460928475726304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07062925598358409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055402303935574285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11660580834053393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08556939787003248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912384570440518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19297597825787702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09971657931834675,0.0,0.0,0.2769139271358946,0.0,0.08013478450845066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784375846763747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11188643718852762,0.4046625740799672,0.0,0.0,0.10979284560337627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383085461082557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327141933461571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23427505633442572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983382299427709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021105079348017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10430782980511717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05985540960788133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012923304949033,0.0,0.23831161325333228,0.09456589355536646,0.0,0.0,0.047496698928120716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2249522962364111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06163276029825011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3123667417792343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912384570440518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05599707449877226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21204101843194367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08556939787003248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10979284560337627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21568751693527494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372965139425971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341264942072165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327141933461571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
System Impact Analysis of Carbon Capture Loads on Rural Electric Distribution Systems,"In an effort to reduce carbon emissions, carbon capture systems are being implemented in agriculture related industries across Iowa. This paper presents a recent distribution system impact study conducted for a rural electric cooperative to accommodate the pumping of methane gas collected from hog confinement sewage lagoons. The analysis of the distribution system considered conductor and equipment capacity, voltage drop, power quality and motor starting impacts and protective device evaluations. Upon implementation of the study recommendations the distribution system will be able to support the new loads and allow for the capture of methane previously dispersed into the atmosphere.",Distributed Systems,system impact analysi carbon captur load rural electr distribut system,effort reduc carbon emiss carbon captur system implement agricultur relat industri across iowa paper present recent distribut system impact studi conduct rural electr cooper accommod pump methan ga collect hog confin sewag lagoon analysi distribut system consid conductor equip capac voltag drop power qualiti motor start impact protect devic evalu upon implement studi recommend distribut system abl support new load allow captur methan previous dispers atmospher,system impact analysi carbon captur load rural electr distribut system effort reduc carbon emiss carbon captur system implement agricultur relat industri across iowa paper present recent distribut system impact studi conduct rural electr cooper accommod pump methan ga collect hog confin sewag lagoon analysi distribut system consid conductor equip capac voltag drop power qualiti motor start impact protect devic evalu upon implement studi recommend distribut system abl support new load allow captur methan previous dispers atmospher,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11004498190371916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13218632958741575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799997750816105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13949996629837286,0.41849989889511857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13005096156518112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11123908897083754,0.0,0.0,0.10563638742480222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096950227176113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32080316601745257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13949996629837286,0.0,0.23293370981283765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13949996629837286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09135477708160408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32006367578568906,0.18410456153207982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265804072293692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23580943848843522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08934149855782135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059218865720001526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09349014510383867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.076843701529207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344595560440981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017187107886286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668789192856301,0.0,0.13949996629837286,0.0,0.10668789192856301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11508539215799392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15099488793231886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097364682989932,0.0,0.3487595929034933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13218632958741575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Detection of Faulty Regions in Power Distribution Grid with Limited Measurement,"Restoration of power supply after occurrence of faults in distribution lines is utmost challenging task for operators due to lack of sufficient real time information in the distribution system territory. Recently initiatives are taken by distribution companies to install micro phasor measurement units (μPMUs) and sensors to monitor and recognize the injurious area in the system. However, implementation of the projects are still challenging due to high investment cost. The present study tries to highlight a machine learning based approach to identify faulty region in the distribution system with limited installation of μPMU. A random forest (RF) classifier is utilized to assess the faulty region in the distribution grid with low state information supplied by μPMUs. The method endows the training with a large simulated data obtained from installed μPMUs for different types and location of faults in three phases of the system. Proposed methodology has been tested on IEEE 13 bus unbalanced distribution system. The efficacy of the proposed approach is established with the test results. The investigation also depicts the efficiency of RF algorithm in fault detection in comparison with other classifier such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN).",Distributed Systems,detect faulti region power distribut grid limit measur,restor power suppli occurr fault distribut line utmost challeng task oper due lack suffici real time inform distribut

Stability Analysis of A DC Distribution System for Power System Integration of Plug-In Electric Vehicles,"DC power distribution system is an important development direction of future urban power distribution system, while the charging and discharging requirements of electric vehicles have a great impact on the stability of the DC power distribution system. Firstly, a stability model of DC power distribution system integration of electric vehicles under different charging and discharging modes is established, and the stability of DC power distribution system is compared according to Nyquist stability criterion, when electric vehicles are charged and discharged in different ways. Finally, a DC power distribution system time domain example with electric vehicle is made in DIgSILENT simulation software, and simulation results verify the correctness of theoretical analysis.",Distributed Systems,stabil analysi dc distribut system power system integr plugin electr vehicl,dc power distribut system import develop direct futur urban power distribut system charg discharg requir electr vehicl great impact stabil dc power distribut system firstli stabil model dc power distribut system integr electr vehicl differ charg discharg mode establish stabil dc power distribut system compar accord nyquist stabil criterion electr vehicl charg discharg differ way final dc power distribut system time domain exampl electr vehicl made digsil simul softwar simul result verifi correct theoret analysi,stabil analysi dc distribut system power system integr plugin electr vehicl dc power distribut system import develop direct futur urban power distribut system charg discharg requir electr vehicl great impact stabil dc power distribut system firstli stabil model dc power distribut system integr electr vehicl differ charg discharg mode establish stabil dc power distribut system compar accord nyquist stabil criterion electr vehicl charg discharg differ way final dc power distribut system time domain exampl electr vehicl made digsil simul softwar simul result verifi correct theoret analysi,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787559355593552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08925137256615412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25757344701342455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052900292717013374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07375205469639033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5151468940268491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033021345048779474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08054630417910197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05706412248436442,0.0,0.2783682092706881,0.0,0.0,0.06079417734301249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28874554576937855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05846206207647953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787559355593552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05138064586355649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050902124934990155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787559355593552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052900292717013374,0.0,0.04748346129579307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09655491616453368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0634864068383077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787559355593552,0.03833060512308774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3244941077120984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04245911653396492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034433420555324314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09655491616453368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040531896397203594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779608390652943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23057267597982317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0666706384834673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04529749685137913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174320341915384,0.06079417734301249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05920536239390319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

With the continuous expansion of the application scope of key equipment in emerging distribution networks represented by intelligent terminals, new-generation business master stations, low-voltage intelligent switches, grid-connected inverters, etc., various emerging technologies and the power industry further intersect, so that the specific realization of the key functions of the power distribution system gradually evolves from the original independent policy control to the complex digital application scenario of multi-level division of labor, multi-equipment cooperation and multi-strategy collaboration, which has triggered profound changes in the production mode of the industry.Based on the top architecture of ""cloud-side, channel layer, edge-side and perception layer"" and intelligent equipment represented by intelligent terminal, the digitalized system of low-voltage distribution system reconstructs the data flow and signal flow of low-voltage platform area, which is an important research part to support the construction of new power system. This paper mainly introduces the basic situation of the digitalized system of low-voltage distribution system and its key equipment and core technology, analyzes the application scenario of digitalized business, and discusses the related comprehensive evaluation and test and detection technology.",Distributed Systems,overview digit applic scenario low voltag distribut system base

Weibull Distribution Based Reliability Analysis of Radial Distribution System with Aging Effect of Transformer,"Reliability is associated with the system’s capability to survive. In the past years, consumer’s expectations have been increased with the development and advancement in modem technologies. They are expecting more quality supply with less cost and fewer failures. Therefore, reliability investigation of the Radial Distribution System (RDS) significantly ensures the service continuity at the consumer’s end. Further, with the age, equipment failure rate also increases, which also increases the failure frequency and interruption cost significantly for consumers. A prediction of the failure rate for proper maintenance scheduling and replacement of old equipment is necessary. To achieve the future recurrence rate of interruption for the transformer in real-time, the Weibull Probability Density Function is used here. In this research work, the frequency of interruption with different time intervals, variable shape parameters having an effect on Expected Interruption Cost (ECOST) and Energy Not Served (ENS) is studied. The applicability of the proposed work is validated on well established Roy Billionton Test System (RBTS).",Distributed Systems,weibul distribut base reliabl analysi radial distribut system age effect transform,reliabl associ system capabl surviv past year consum expect increas develop advanc modem technolog expect qualiti suppli less cost fewer failur therefor reliabl investig radial distribut system rd significantli ensur servic continu consum end age equip failur rate also increas also increas failur frequenc interrupt cost significantli consum predict failur rate proper mainten schedul replac old equip necessari achiev futur recurr rate interrupt transform realtim weibul probabl densiti function use research work frequenc interrupt differ time interv variabl shape paramet effect expect interrupt cost ecost energi serv en studi applic propos work valid well establish roy billionton test system rbt,weibul distribut base reliabl analysi radial distribut system age effect transform reliabl associ system capabl surviv past year consum expect increas develop advanc modem technolog expect qualiti suppli less cost fewer failur therefor reliabl investig radial distribut system rd significantli ensur servic continu consum end age equip failur rate also increas also increas failur frequenc interrupt cost significantli consum predict failur rate proper mainten schedul replac old equip necessari achiev futur recurr rate interrupt transform realtim weibul probabl densiti function use research work frequenc interrupt differ time interv variabl shape paramet effect expect interrupt cost ecost energi serv en studi applic propos work valid well establish roy billionton test system rbt,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0715402027267715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763032607229715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123505997608758,0.0,0.06500870629405693,0.0,0.0,0.05756973745722039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049894656844119714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07784567945681971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887813260780944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465048119926748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04810402036382525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05866812891387045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737918738096478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11442779569924359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887813260780944,0.083128464512173,0.0,0.0,0.083128464512173,0.0,0.2015271926425481,0.0,0.0851649204623218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3022907889638221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4112002090856913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21487739737726075,0.07784567945681971,0.07415194174609334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19796210975811762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08035020332714234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248416146782389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248416146782389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050430300148525536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347344507813941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22023858655384984,0.0,0.0,0.28644243379776224,0.0,0.0,0.09548081126592074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23846302822779114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05269331251297304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08737867411398337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18787678506414507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05453330326132724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11011929327692492,0.0,0.0,0.1679439872041956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057213897849621796,0.07415194174609334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841263224931379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598736991937254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18496832293564777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038881678127891256,0.0,0.0,0.09548081126592074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763032607229715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001741258811386,0.0841263224931379
Optimal Location of Battery Storage Systems to Minimize Losses in the Distribution System Considering Power Quality Indicators,"The document presents the optimal allocation of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for radial distribution networks to reduce losses in the grid. The optimization process is performed using the genetic algorithm combined with the iterative forward-backward sweep-based power flow considering long-duration voltage variations as constraints. The proposed approach is performed using Matlab/Matpower to obtain the optimal allocation and sizing of BESS in the distribution network.

Electro-thermal Resource Interaction to Accommodate Inevitable Uncertain Events of Distribution Network,"Transition of the power system towards a carbon-neutral grid with increased prosumers at the distribution end motivates the distribution market to be more robust. Rare uncertain events like power supply failures from the main grid due to contingencies, high forecast errors, etc., could adversely impact the distribution system’s operations. In such situations, distribution system operators (DSOs) are forced to curtail the load at the cost of high economic losses and consumers’ discomfort. This entails the DSOs to be more diligent to accommodate these rare, inevitable, and uncertain events. Electro-thermal interaction could significantly help the DSO to maintain an economical and reliable system. In this regard, this work formulates the distribution optimal power flow (D-OPF) to accommodate these rare events and prevent the system from collapsing or heavy load shedding via efficient deployment of the network’s available resources. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated on IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system considering different real-time scenarios. The results highlight the primacy of simultaneous modeling of electro-thermal resources to cater for the distribution network under uncertain events in an economically efficient way.",Distributed Systems,electrotherm resourc interact accommod inevit uncertain event distribut network,transit power system toward carbonneutr grid increas prosum distribut end motiv distribut market robust rare uncertain event like power suppli failur main grid due conting high forecast error etc could advers impact distribut system oper situat distribut system oper dso forc curtail load cost high econom loss consum discomfort entail dso dilig accommod rare inevit uncertain event electrotherm interact could significantli help dso maintain econom reliabl system regard work formul distribut optim power flow dopf accommod rare event prevent system collaps heavi load shed via effici deploy network avail resourc efficaci propos framework demonstr ieee 33bu radial distribut system consid differ realtim scenario result highlight primaci simultan model electrotherm resourc cater distribut network uncertain event econom effici way,electrotherm resourc interact accommod inevit uncertain event distribut network transit power system toward carbonneutr grid increas prosum distribut end motiv distribut market robust rare uncertain event like power suppli failur main grid due conting high forecast error etc could advers impact distribut system oper situat distribut system oper dso forc curtail load cost high econom loss consum discomfort entail dso dilig accommod rare inevit uncertain event electrotherm interact could significantli help dso maintain econom reliabl system regard work formul distribut optim power flow dopf accommod rare event prevent system collaps heavi load shed via effici deploy network avail resourc efficaci propos framework demonstr ieee 33bu radial distribut system consid differ realtim scenario result highlight primaci simultan model electrotherm resourc cater distribut network uncertain event econom effici way,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07890825889303162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07157043447372669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707165821843964,0.1821972348698675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07157043447372669,0.0,0.08089808019697102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05502914864111716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43469911329105904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0708786749939919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276871392308044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09274506546168072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09109861743493375,0.0,0.0,0.09451358040951549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47256790204757737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642372207001304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08545742829755174,0.0,0.0,0.09274506546168072,0.07157043447372669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17091485659510347,0.0,0.07536635928383828,0.1524075592581424,0.0,0.08955846816319023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642372207001304,0.0,0.07228284651298553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06189440254793998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16613806707178805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988243623740351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15976487247480703,0.0,0.0,0.09109861743493375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306903353589402,0.09451358040951549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052374856632332684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516845797686828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11848022107831101,0.0,0.06710281242217046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19002345121438197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04730228378279268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10328897597683587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08955846816319023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09451358040951549,0.0,0.0,0.07455733160232421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21263602498197573,0.0,0.04704975199725338,0.0,0.0,0.08955846816319023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988243623740351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881117203063362,0.0,0.0,0.09451358040951549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10328897597683587,0.0,0.0,0.23629050746128158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762037796290712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089808019697102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06097644202824776,0.0
An Online Monitoring Method for Stabilizing Inflection Points of Photovoltaic Distribution Systems Containing a High Percentage,"The conventional online monitoring method for the stability inflection point of high proportion photovoltaic distribution system mainly uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) to obtain the monitoring threshold, which is vulnerable to the influence of frequency spectrum and frequency band fitting, resulting in abnormal inflection point status monitoring. Based on this, an online monitoring method for the stability inflection point of high proportion photovoltaic distribution system is proposed. That is, the dynamic characteristics of online monitoring of stability inflection point of high proportion photovoltaic distribution system are extracted, and the stability of online monitoring of stability inflection point of high proportion photovoltaic distribution system is judged, thus realizing online monitoring of stability inflection point of distribution system. The experimental results show that the online monitoring method with high proportion of photovoltaic distribution system stability inflection point in this paper can normally complete inflection point status monitoring under different time stamps, which proves that the designed online monitoring method has good monitoring effect, reliability and certain application value, and has made certain contributions to ensuring the operation reliability of distribution system.",Distributed Systems,onlin monitor method stabil inflect point photovolta distribut system contain high percentag,convent

A Generalized Framework for Service Restoration in a Resilient Power Distribution System,"An electric power grid is one of the complex infrastructures, and because of its complex nature, there is simply no way that outages can be completely avoided. Thus, a modern society that depends on reliable electric supply requires a resilient electric system that can recover from disruptions while integrating emerging smart grid technologies. This article presents a novel approach for service restoration in a modern power distribution system with controllable switches and distributed generation (DG) resources for any kind of outage. The proposed framework supports both the traditional service restoration using feeder reconfiguration and the grid-forming DG-assisted intentional islands that are dynamically sized using algorithms based on the fault scenario, available resources, and priority of loads. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates critical system connectivity and operating constraints. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a large-scale four-feeder 1069-bus three-phase unbalanced distribution test system. It is demonstrated that the framework is effective in utilizing all available resources in quickly restoring the power supply to improve resiliency during extreme events and is scalable for a large-scale unbalanced power distribution system.",Distributed Systems,gener framework servic restor resili power distribut system,electr power grid one complex infrastructur complex natur simpli way

Fault Location Algorithm for Multi-Terminal Transmission Lines of Distribution System Based on Loop-Analysis,"The safe and stable operation of power system is highly affected by transmission line fault. With the rapid development and application of multi-terminal transmission lines in distribution network, the researches on fault location methods of multi-terminal transmission lines are attracting more and more attention. However, the fault location algorithms for multi-terminal transmission lines is complicated and time-consuming. To improve the effectiveness and accuracy of fault location, a novel fault location algorithm for multi-terminal transmission lines in the distribution network is proposed in this paper. First, the directed graphs of distribution system with multi-terminal transmission lines are constructed and the nodes are classified as T-type and non-T-type nodes. Then the system is divided into multiple regions by each T-type node and the voltages of T-type node in different regions have been calculated by the loop-voltage equation to identify the fault region. Finally, non-fault regions have been merged to establish a new distribution system until both the fault branch and distance are determined. A practical distribution system has been established on the CloudPSS platform to test the method, and test results verify the practicality and accuracy of the proposed method.",Distributed Systems,fault locat algorithm multitermin transmiss line distribut system base loopanalysi,safe stabl oper power system highli affect transmiss line fault rapid develop applic multitermin transmiss line distribut network research fault locat method multitermin transmiss line attract attent howev fault locat algorithm multitermin transmiss line complic timeconsum improv effect accuraci fault locat novel fault locat algorithm multitermin transmiss line distribut network propos paper first direct graph distribut system multitermin transmiss line construct node classifi ttype nonttyp node system divid multipl region ttype node voltag ttype node differ region calcul loopvoltag equat identifi fault region final nonfault region merg establish new distribut system fault branch distanc determin practic distribut system establish cloudpss platform test method test result verifi practic accuraci propos method,fault locat algorithm multitermin transmiss line distribut system base loopanalysi safe stabl oper power system highli affect transmiss line fault rapid develop applic multitermin transmiss line distribut network research fault locat method multitermin transmiss line attract attent howev fault locat algorithm multitermin transmiss line complic timeconsum improv effect accuraci fault locat novel fault locat algorithm multitermin transmiss line distribut network propos paper first direct graph distribut system multitermin transmiss line construct node classifi ttype nonttyp node system divid multipl region ttype node voltag ttype node differ region calcul loopvoltag equat identifi fault region final nonfault region merg establish new distribut system fault branch distanc determin practic distribut system establish cloudpss platform test method test result verifi practic accuraci propos method,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330402648430356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05932716497074891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13000580698175299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0357710545832602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031002130150590012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0626096324773464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0566104696805055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05579959948586159,0.029889515118725618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0364535419887102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05165201324215178,0.0,0.21597175456259723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035549953036014936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10583473724195845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5220040597144548,0.0,0.0,0.04650757227120954,0.0,0.05165201324215178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03692547264414797,0.0,0.0,0.04369869886014508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0357710545832602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.456753552250148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3017371118564326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224963819255736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05579959948586159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06698801555394839,0.0,0.040097775921439864,0.24138968948514605,0.05429288822911226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03924305409554121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026578296159042652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05932716497074891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04195974938578462,0.08138878801391435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06266990606318464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05836878045909941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03274107962495047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031167665725228975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15652842444372228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214887101492454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40858146321369593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055028300032606385,0.0,0.0,0.05932716497074891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Impact of Electric Bus Charging on the Power Distribution System a Case Study IEEE 33 Bus Test System,"Electric buses (Ebus) have become increasingly used, especially in the metropolitan area, to reduce pollution from carbon monoxide and dust. However, the use of an Ebus requires charging from the power distribution system, which may affect the stability of the system. This paper is a study of the impact of electric bus charging on the power distribution system a case study IEEE 33 bus test system. The study also included Ebus charging integrated with distributed generation (DG) system to improve voltage level. The power flow was calculated using the Newton-Raphson method and the size and location of DG calculated by the voltage deviation index (VDI). The simulation results show the impact of Ebus charging on the system. The fast charging of 6 minutes at 300 kW power, system voltage dropped 0.8139 p.u., mean voltage 0.9014 p.u. The voltage improvement by installing DG on buses 18 and 33 at 1.0 MW and 1.4 MW respectively. The results show that the system voltage increased to 0.9533 p.u., the voltage means 0.9735 p.u. The Ebus charging causes the voltage drop on the power system, which affects the reliability of the system. It is a larger load than the charging of electric vehicles. The installation of DG into the system makes it possible to adjust the voltage level to the standard value.",Distributed Systems,impact electr bu charg power distribut system case studi ieee 33 bu test system,electr buse ebu becom increasingli use especi metropolitan area reduc pollut carbon monoxid dust howev use ebu requir charg power distribut system may affect stabil system paper studi impact electr bu charg power distribut system case studi ieee 33 bu test system studi also includ ebu charg integr distribut gener dg system improv voltag level power flow calcul use newtonraphson method size locat dg calcul voltag deviat index vdi simul result show impact ebu charg system fast charg 6 minut 300 kw power system voltag drop 08139 pu mean voltag 09014 pu voltag improv instal dg buse 18 33 10 mw 14 mw respect result show system voltag increas 09533 pu voltag mean 09735 pu ebu charg caus voltag drop power system affect reliabl system larger load charg electr vehicl instal dg system make possibl adjust voltag level standard valu,impact electr bu charg power distribut system case studi ieee 33 bu test system electr buse ebu becom increasingli use especi metropolitan area reduc pollut carbon monoxid dust howev use ebu requir charg power distribut system may affect stabil system paper studi impact electr bu charg power distribut system case studi ieee 33 bu test system studi also includ ebu charg integr distribut gener dg system improv voltag level power flow calcul use newtonraphson method size locat dg calcul voltag deviat index vdi simul result show impact ebu charg system fast charg 6 minut 300 kw power system voltag drop 08139 pu mean voltag 09014 pu voltag improv instal dg buse 18 33 10 mw 14 mw respect result show system voltag increas 09533 pu voltag mean 09735 pu ebu charg caus voltag drop power system affect reliabl system larger load charg electr vehicl instal dg system make possibl adjust voltag level standard valu,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10520804778674998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03094911718856314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03842437990599808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04579864451757866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2314244582831218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938412116838889,0.04879231986147093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5512635831812986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25676642098117064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12766477035049612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853936102895395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055514511849969854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05019519306470748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03132797899808467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03274096185456753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11327294634867129,0.0,0.12737048756087618,0.0,0.0,0.06343473216415477,0.03608277718518746,0.0,0.036354961147450966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03874662475582394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08951974116102054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04692060584194445,0.0,0.05350866251384059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04203837919888151,0.0,0.0,0.044267994371002525,0.1157122291415609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030220795781169332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023566359978347495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0517542465312727,0.0,0.22322843105731952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04245682918695872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04379279518144939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0340769278490582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05527129547886007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762187542600377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03874662475582394,0.0,0.0,0.05785611457078045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060668922455296294,0.0,0.0517542465312727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12017791427239018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.300711949816372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817062708964202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06426420235028311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05260402389337499,0.0,0.05095305512290511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734362150403749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Hardware-in-the-Loop platform based on Smart Meters for Demonstrating Advanced Distribution Management Systems,"As the number of distributed energy resources grows, distribution system operators are facing significant challenges in monitoring and controlling their distribution networks. This evolution of the distribution power grid has led to the development of new techniques for monitoring and validating the state of the distribution grid. This paper presents a test-bed with smart meters that serve to validate power distribution smart grid techniques, including topology identification, distribution state estimation, and advanced control such as optimal power flow. The test-bed uses an emulated cyber-physical environment incorporating the actual smart meters that are used on distribution power grids.

Modeling and fault simulation of power generation unit in shipboard zonal distribution power system,"To ensure the stable operation of the ship’s power system, the most effective and direct method is to ensure the stability of the ship’s power grid voltage and frequency. The excitation control system of the synchronous generator determines the voltage stability and reactive power output, and the prime mover speed control system determines the frequency stability and active power output. Based on Matlab/Simulink, this paper establishes a model of ship power generation unit and a shipboard zonal distribution power system. Finally, the common working conditions and faults in ships are simulated. The results show the validity of the model. Provides a basis for studying the control of power generation units and the faults of the distribution network.",Distributed Systems,model fault simul power gener unit shipboard zonal distribut power system,ensur stabl oper ship power system effect direct method ensur stabil ship power grid voltag frequenc excit control system synchron gener determin voltag stabil reactiv power output prime mover speed control system determin frequenc stabil activ power output base matlabsimulink paper establish model ship power gener unit shipboard zonal distribut power system final common work condit fault ship simul result show valid model provid basi studi control power gener unit fault distribut network,model fault simul power gener unit shipboard zonal distribut power system ensur stabl oper ship power system effect direct method ensur stabil ship power grid voltag frequenc excit control system synchron gener determin voltag stabil reactiv power output prime mover speed control system determin frequenc stabil activ power output base matlabsimulink paper establish model ship power gener unit shipboard zonal distribut power system final common work condit fault ship simul result show valid model provid basi studi control power gener unit fault distribut network,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07730798005128198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04640113538252503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09032246822508078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19621257300713524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16703141090354154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07730798005128198,0.0,0.1616233235197521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05320789815583502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15461596010256395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920184753570259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2929828643312248,0.0,0.0,0.0696082542324238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19983212305671913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2115261533123605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08472934133732332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05101261624648677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15578588755243727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050130748494169125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05873539195745575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18741667225574152,0.03977994777526964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5652134231320242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054560306945828085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04664889379693515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06432851884521319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13080838200475683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3072268991568041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050714993298593206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1952311174142623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2758646661409166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08879544083898137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17759088167796275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060456930112123754,0.0
Energy Storage as a Non-Wires Alternative for Deferring Distribution Capacity Investments,"There is growing interest in Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and other distributed energy resources (DER) as non-wires alternatives to resolve distribution issues while also providing valuable services to the grid and to energy customers. One such use is to defer distribution capacity investments required due to load and/or DER growth. Selecting ESS power and energy ratings for capacity deferral requires time-series load profile data. This paper is a part of a longer-term objective of making it easy for utilities to consider energy storage systems within distribution planning. This paper proposes a practical planning-based approach to screen ESS (both power and energy ratings) to defer distribution capacity investments. More specifically, an approach is presented here that leverages linear power flow approximation to quickly perform many time-series ESS dispatch simulations enabling rapid ESS project screening for a large number of distribution feeders. This paper also illustrates intuitive ways to visualize optimal ESS power and energy ratings for different peak clipping objectives.

Combined Symmetry of Exponential and Extreme Hyperbolic Distributions in Macrosystems,"An extended entropy method has been developed that accounts for the finite properties of distributions and the stagewise character of relaxation processes. The kinetic properties of system agents (carriers and resources) determine the distribution type. If the time of relaxation of carriers is shorter, the exponential distribution is formed, whereas if the dynamic resources are more agile, an extreme heavy-tail hyperbolic distribution is formed. The exponential and extreme hyperbolic distributions have been found to possess combined symmetry, which is a different statistical interpretation of a single state.",Distributed Systems,combin symmetri exponenti extrem hyperbol distribut macrosystem,extend entropi method develop account finit properti distribut stagewis charact relax process kinet properti system agent carrier resourc determin distribut type time relax carrier shorter exponenti distribut form wherea dynam resourc agil extrem heavytail hyperbol distribut form exponenti extrem hyperbol distribut found possess combin symmetri differ statist interpret singl state,combin symmetri exponenti extrem hyperbol distribut macrosystem extend entropi method develop account finit properti distribut stagewis charact relax process kinet properti system agent carrier resourc determin distribut type time relax carrier shorter exponenti distribut form wherea dynam resourc agil extrem heavytail hyperbol distribut form exponenti extrem hyperbol distribut found possess combin symmetri differ statist interpret singl state,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19910345781334568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006042671462708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16237118998504382,0.08697546546249192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060761196570306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6284559587273041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16984724672658474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35120978907522876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898723761770366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09917870129200727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09167353911173039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27325644664532217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18586975326077512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17263604870820456,0.0,0.0,0.18586975326077512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07591364686482799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11930982420960115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17263604870820456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Optimal Placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Station by Considering Dynamic Loads in Radial Distribution System,"Electric vehicles with unique characteristics like lower noise, energy saving and pollution free due to reduction of carbon dioxide are consider to be the best choice for future automobile industry. The battery of electric vehicle (EV) must get recharged at charging stations when they are used for driving in urban area. Since electric charging stations will be used simultaneously by many EV. The existing distribution system might not be highly affected by the installation of charging stations if the numbers of electric vehicles are small. However, with the increase in the number of electric vehicles the characteristics of the electric vehicle charging patterns may have considerable impact on distribution systems which depends particularly on the electric vehicle charging location. There may be significant impacts like overloading and power losses in the system. These impacts could be mitigated by proper system planning and through strategic placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) in the existing radial distribution network. In this research the optimal location EVCS are identified in radial distribution network and also the active power losses and system voltage profile are examined. This research proposes a heuristic algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize the IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system with electric vehicle charging stations. The prime objective is to place the EVCS at optimal location in existing radial distribution network by considering the real (active) power losses and also the voltage at the buses of the system.",Distributed Systems,optim placement electr vehicl charg station consid dynam load radial distribut system,electr vehicl uniqu characterist like lower nois energi save pollut free due reduct

A Graph-theoretic Method for Identification of Electric Power Distribution System Topology,"In this paper, we present a graph-theoretic method for identification of the topology of electric power distribution system based on the real-time measurements. Instead of relying on the electric-circuit based approaches, this new approach utilizes the principles of network theory to find the connecting structure or topology of a distribution system. First, we put forth the theoretical foundation for the proposed approach. Second, applying some principles and methods of network theory, we develop and present the process of topology identification. Third, the algorithm for practical implementation of the concepts is offered with an illustrative example. Finally, the potential applications and the insights obtained from this work are discussed.",Distributed Systems,graphtheoret method identif electr power distribut system topolog,paper present graphtheoret method identif topolog electr power distribut system base realtim measur instead reli electriccircuit base approach new approach util principl network theori find connect structur topolog distribut system first put forth theoret foundat propos approach second appli principl method network theori develop present process topolog identif third algorithm practic implement concept offer illustr exampl final potenti applic insight obtain work discuss,graphtheoret method identif electr power distribut system topolog paper present graphtheoret method identif topolog electr power distribut system base realtim measur instead reli electriccircuit base approach new approach util principl network theori find connect structur topolog distribut system first put forth theoret foundat propos approach second appli principl method network theori develop present process topolog identif third algorithm practic implement concept offer illustr exampl final potenti applic insight obtain work discuss,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08251918953335628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693233724159716,0.06811538272390515,0.2257787441031166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11806875615302556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10478510519287144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10204661692227458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056915732160066165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693233724159716,0.20562713192231313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1990732251656661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699066459371646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855990190167866,0.09612512298071099,0.09835596661709393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4135686186201657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786710709698276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11491379885526133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09721988411383911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19470416290511555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12755884249237132,0.0,0.07635434250083364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930611978820151,0.10779787885460262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0506104960033719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08940791892044317,0.15979983937903647,0.07749042500408848,0.0,0.0,0.13134658362139712,0.0,0.22594204140673743,0.0,0.0,0.05999009686816461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059668140714569134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11297102070336872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699066459371646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10076546130252369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14903102050482334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11491379885526133,0.2432620058310583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46796265837486584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08773512117384837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07691702455471697,0.0
Using 0.6 kV/1 kV Low Voltage in Distribution Systems for the Reduction of the Technical and Non-Technical Energy Losses,"In this paper, the effect of raising the distribution system voltage level to 0.6 kV and 1 kV on the technical and nontechnical energy losses has been investigated. This investigation has been based on a case study in the Jordanian Electricity Distribution Company (EDCO) network. It presents technical and cost comparison between different distribution networks including different system typologies for the 0.4 kV, 0.6 kV and 1 kV distribution systems. The distribution network of Karak city in Jordan has been modeled using CYME software and updated with the grid data needed to perform the analysis, such as transmission line parameters and lengths; and transformers ratings. The study has been performed, firstly, by analyzing the current situation of the grid with 0.4 kV distribution voltage. Then the grid voltage has been raised to 0.6 kV and 1 kV to reduce the technical and non-technical energy losses.

DC coupled Distribution System Groups enable lowering Provision of Ancillary Services,"Since a significant number of renewable energy plants (RES) are connected to the distribution grid level, the ratio of feed-in to load in the distribution grids is very different. Today's centralized distribution system groups mean that balancing between systems is usually carried out via the transmission system, leading to additional bottlenecks and even to the shutdown of RES installations. This contribution presents a new approach to power balancing at the distribution system level. By means of DC couplings, controllable power transits between high-feed and high-load system groups are enabled, with the result that transmission losses and ancillary services to be provided can be reduced. The evaluation is carried out on basis of a generic medium-term model and shows that the concept idea enables a relief of the transmission system within the scope of power-frequency control as well as saving reserve power for power system restoration.",Distributed Systems,dc coupl distribut system group enabl lower provis ancillari servic,sinc signific number renew energi plant re connect distribut grid level ratio feedin load distribut grid differ today central distribut system group mean balanc system usual carri via transmiss system lead addit bottleneck even shutdown re instal contribut present new approach power balanc distribut system level mean dc coupl control power transit highfe highload system group enabl result transmiss loss ancillari servic provid reduc evalu carri basi gener mediumterm model show concept idea enabl relief transmiss system within scope powerfrequ control well save reserv power power system restor,dc coupl distribut system group enabl lower provis ancillari servic sinc signific number renew energi plant re connect distribut grid level ratio feedin load distribut grid differ today central distribut system group mean balanc system usual carri via transmiss system lead addit bottleneck even shutdown re instal contribut present new approach power balanc distribut system level mean dc coupl control power transit highfe highload system group enabl result transmiss loss ancillari servic provid reduc evalu carri basi gener mediumterm model show concept idea enabl relief transmiss system within scope powerfrequ control well save reserv power power system restor,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09175545701909656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710294745401442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20347779119776366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09889546056759185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631089419929804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08972526217555171,0.15706837926731637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2793342584839129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06551337806469379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3234491180659641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28530524504823057,0.0,0.09282768386083486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07368660963040513,0.11041498346361683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06349759389313095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20347779119776366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975737971876528,0.0,0.18144445800376102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951017483494102,0.0,0.0,0.10845485188419514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23453310329877822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062353386675409184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07206270255736023,0.0,0.0,0.09175545701909656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3016359755506955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06198200048236183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06551337806469379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08605427429162782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056013735748457805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951475943753056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07724257452643384,0.0,0.08438257807492915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3750785351805998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3146966609644993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08520613252643011,0.0,0.0,0.09889546056759185,0.0,0.0,0.0
Optimal Placement of Voltage Regulator and Capacitor for Distribution System,"The radial distribution system (RDS) is the ultimate link between the high-voltage transmission system (HVT) and the user in most electrical systems in Ethiopia. The Distribution System (DS) is divided into different areas for proper operation and supply of electricity demand. The study in this paper applies specifically to the Gondar feeder, which consists of 60 nodes with 3,413 MW of total capacity, in power distribution lines.

Joint Sparse Estimation of Sensitivity Distribution Factors and Power Flows in Low-Observable Power Distribution Systems,"Sensitivity distribution factors (SDFs) have diverse applications in power system operation. In particular, when SDFs are obtained in a data-driven fashion based on measurements, they can eliminate the need to repeatedly solve the computationally complex non-linear power flow equations. However, in a typical low-observable power distribution system, where the measurements are not sufficient to achieve full-observability, it is a major challenge to estimate SDFs using the available measurements. This challenge is addressed in this paper. Specifically, a new method is proposed for joint estimation of SDF and power flows in power distribution systems that lack full-observability. The proposed method requires measuring the nodal injection power and line power flow at only a few locations on the power distribution feeder. The proposed method is physics-aware. It is built upon extracting physics-based sparsity features of power distribution feeders. In this regard, the aforementioned joint estimation problem is formulated as a sparse matrix completion problem. The advantages of the proposed method in comparison with the existing methods are investigated via numerical results.",Distributed Systems,joint spars estim sensit distribut factor power flow lowobserv power distribut system,sensit distribut factor sdf divers applic power system oper particular sdf obtain datadriven fashion base measur elimin need repeatedli solv comput complex nonlinear power flow equat howev typic lowobserv power distribut system measur suffici achiev fullobserv major challeng estim sdf use avail measur challeng address paper specif new method propos joint estim sdf power flow power distribut system lack fullobserv propos method requir measur nodal inject power line power flow locat power distribut feeder propos method physicsawar built upon extract physicsbas sparsiti featur power distribut feeder regard aforement joint estim problem formul spars matrix complet problem advantag propos method comparison exist method investig via numer result,joint spars estim sensit distribut factor power flow lowobserv power distribut system sensit distribut factor sdf divers applic power system oper particular sdf obtain datadriven fashion base measur elimin need repeatedli solv comput complex nonlinear power flow equat howev typic lowobserv power distribut system measur suffici achiev fullobserv major challeng estim sdf use avail measur challeng address paper specif new method propos joint estim sdf power flow power distribut system lack fullobserv propos method requir measur nodal inject power line power flow locat power distribut feeder propos method physicsawar built upon extract physicsbas sparsiti featur power distribut feeder regard aforement joint estim problem formul spars matrix complet problem advantag propos method comparison exist method investig via numer result,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05727508216012882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06296993435367379,0.0,0.0,0.0791618272397363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04609032847436195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06735152891621404,0.039945659379980826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09515554870089232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775651436833184,0.06232324646505249,0.0,0.0,0.05243395836933185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.324654782917828,0.07404281431534154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33629618776250364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055378927283260174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644193197016058,0.0,0.14588304275957428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06904992537015239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29176608551914857,0.0,0.0,0.0791618272397363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757777435044616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06432836813059471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823017158953051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08407404694062591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775651436833184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07404281431534154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26313565094151187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2195778805696272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053232843411105964,0.0,0.0,0.05166522723026987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791618272397363,0.0,0.0,0.06296993435367379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05056393429471547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03424563280369188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.594707793735978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11260989690300305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16149798151387518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067132937954805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04951914335811565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04015894884259769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775651436833184,0.059366040267750934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344559464299692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644193197016058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031128669257534745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Flower Pollination Algorithm Based Sizing and Placement of DG and D-STATCOM Simultaneously in Radial Distribution Systems,"In this paper, various distribution systems are analyzed for optimal placement and sizing of Distributed Generation (DG) & Distribution Static Compensator (D-STATCOM) incorporated by Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA). The Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) is considered as a critical aspect in determining the selection of candidate buses for installation of DG and D-STATCOM. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of FPA it is implemented on 15, 33 and 69 bus radial distribution systems (RDS) to derive the locations and sizing of DG and D-STATCOM based on the selected candidate buses. Comparison of the results obtained by the FPA with the base case infers that the power losses are reduced with increased net saving and improved voltage profiles for the tested distribution systems.",Distributed Systems,flower pollin algorithm base size placement dg dstatcom simultan radial distribut system,paper variou distribut system analyz optim placement size distribut gener dg distribut static compens dstatcom incorpor flower pollin algorithm fpa loss sensit factor lsf consid critic aspect determin select candid buse instal dg dstatcom order demonstr effect fpa implement 15 33 69 bu radial distribut system rd deriv locat size dg dstatcom base select candid buse comparison result obtain fpa base case infer power loss reduc increas net save improv voltag profil test distribut system,flower pollin algorithm base size placement dg dstatcom simultan radial distribut system paper variou distribut system analyz optim placement size distribut gener dg distribut static compens dstatcom incorpor flower pollin algorithm fpa loss sensit factor lsf consid critic aspect determin select candid buse instal dg dstatcom order demonstr effect fpa implement 15 33 69 bu radial distribut system rd deriv locat size dg dstatcom base select candid buse comparison result obtain fpa base case infer power loss reduc increas net save improv voltag profil test distribut system,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15737234089130928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289432729663926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10957604909131732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16887668777711407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11847884347325821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960849022866416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608698641317299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960849022866416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608698641317299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10131832333981867,0.0,0.0,0.525811123444864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3921514896641074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06454995501053666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279066381044105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06415402671928035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750167971168908,0.0,0.0649514209397035,0.0,0.10772351304894474,0.07444837565086983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10957604909131732,0.21915209818263465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873850215725941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071320153007716,0.0960849022866416,0.0,0.0,0.04825963678727943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07618856577283979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24847792910388408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08694389619715329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05659280107371139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2055813276208821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35543653041977463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18947803288659576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083659821888641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214871794687394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10772351304894474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
A Distributed Framework for Agent-based Optimal Energy Management of Distribution Systems,"In recent decades, distribution system restructuring has led to a fundamental shift towards distributed and integrated energy systems. Moreover, electricity market privatization requires distributed control of connected resources to help maintain data privacy. In future distribution systems, each participant will control its local resources optimally while supporting the efficient operation of the power distribution grid by adhering to its system and balance constraints. Consequently, this article proposes an agent-based, integrated, and hierarchical energy management framework for the distribution system operators and involved participants such as industrial or residential prosumers. The goal of such a framework is to optimize the desired targets of each participant locally while maintaining the system security of the distribution grid. The developed framework uses a combination of MATLAB and AKKA to construct the agent-based and hierarchical energy management structure. Finally, we use a distributed optimization routine based on a gradient-descent method to showcase the framework’s operation.",Distributed Systems,distribut framework agentbas optim energi manag distribut system,recent decad distribut system restructur led fundament shift toward distribut integr energi system moreov electr market privat requir distribut control connect resourc help maintain data privaci futur distribut system particip control local resourc optim support effici oper power distribut grid adher system balanc constraint consequ articl propos agentbas integr hierarch energi manag framework distribut system oper involv particip industri residenti prosum goal framework optim desir target particip local maintain system secur distribut grid develop framework use combin matlab akka construct agentbas hierarch energi manag structur final use distribut optim routin base gradientdesc method showcas framework oper,distribut framework agentbas optim energi manag distribut system recent decad distribut system restructur led fundament shift toward distribut integr energi system moreov electr market privat requir distribut control connect resourc help maintain data privaci futur distribut system particip control local resourc optim support effici oper power distribut grid adher system balanc constraint consequ articl propos agentbas integr hierarch energi manag framework distribut system oper involv particip industri residenti prosum goal framework optim desir target particip local maintain system secur distribut grid develop framework use combin matlab akka construct agentbas hierarch energi manag structur final use distribut optim routin base gradientdesc method showcas framework oper,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244518713848307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044491558863494284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07412647377513983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07690795112185972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124241888689494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12542513841148134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047792687592954214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04289483060830176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5165731077348279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06069461870382238,0.0,0.0,0.07501627360353046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965058951005593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06674361984972682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3402018603453663,0.0,0.0,0.06612201966526858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08007872855915255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624848377737899,0.0,0.07164907080515585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06612201966526858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12542513841148134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07897182671533741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18728369822457713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17970379036903608,0.0,0.0,0.1947830758278478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04891326041487703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514118351477461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1689546469349785,0.0,0.25517242462803635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24740712377731514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06021698027287249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08817060854786128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04496919729444417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06871764587038648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05515452531725042,0.0,0.0,0.134765464365722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06612201966526858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07594240168225071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06271256920574067,0.0,0.26207529951888076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244518713848307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06934235369302429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Enhancing Resilience of Distribution Systems Considering Electric Vehicles and Network Reconfiguration in Post-Extreme Events,"After extreme events, the uninterrupted power supply to critical loads in the distribution network faces significant challenges. Electric vehicles (EVs), as mobile energy storage units, can supply power to the distribution network through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, assisting in the restoration of the distribution network after outages. A collaborative fault restoration strategy is proposed considering the spatiotemporal distribution of EVs supplying power to the distribution network, while also considering the network reconfiguration strategy of the distribution network. The probability of EVs selecting V2G stations and the energy distribution of EVs are characterized. Based on this, a collaborative load restoration strategy considering network reconfiguration of the distribution network is constructed, and the model is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. Finally, a case study is conducted using the IEEE 33-node distribution network configuration to verify that the proposed strategy can enhance the load restoration capability in extreme scenarios.",Distributed Systems,enhanc resili distribut system consid electr vehicl network reconfigur postextrem event,extrem event uninterrupt power suppli critic load distribut network face signific challeng electr vehicl ev mobil energi storag unit suppli power distribut network vehicletogrid v2g technolog assist restor distribut network outag collabor fault restor strategi propos consid spatiotempor distribut ev suppli power distribut network also consid network reconfigur strategi distribut network probabl ev select v2g station energi distribut ev character base collabor load restor strategi consid network reconfigur distribut network construct model formul mixedinteg secondord cone program misocp problem final case studi conduct use ieee 33node distribut network configur verifi propos strategi enhanc load restor capabl extrem scenario,enhanc resili distribut system consid electr vehicl network reconfigur postextrem event extrem event uninterrupt power suppli critic load distribut network face signific challeng electr vehicl ev mobil energi storag unit suppli power distribut network vehicletogrid v2g technolog assist restor distribut network outag collabor fault restor strategi propos consid spatiotempor distribut ev suppli power distribut network also consid network reconfigur strategi distribut network probabl ev select v2g station energi distribut ev character base collabor load restor strategi consid network reconfigur distribut network construct model formul mixedinteg secondord cone program misocp problem final case studi conduct use ieee 33node distribut network configur verifi propos strategi enhanc load restor capabl extrem scenario,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04639251288422368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165875483956594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04120562801482812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428905043441135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033366405237514,0.0,0.04907847566137375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16041823099291933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06635741778038168,0.09622277285833944,0.0,0.25206096015387314,0.0,0.0,0.07524224768004277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033366405237514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4784215222732996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13895187060761383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13730370355422672,0.0,0.11920096771944477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16643173959177374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07122790269122622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08672591609973049,0.0,0.0,0.061814259651565395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165875483956594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08489768207114864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2110009921571254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09094229568911241,0.0,0.0,0.04611421164249576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44517638577731494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16730893810080485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058080922866161934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06785887326952918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329598077358766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622277285833944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033366405237514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07524224768004277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06240617024610347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09094229568911241,0.0,0.0,0.08489768207114864,0.2714354930781167,0.0,0.0,0.04503646584094887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27282688706733726,0.0,0.0,0.034674241200231416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047250241632791894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165875483956594,0.0,0.03211053180575156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275655534067784,0.07313935043875622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Active Management of Distribution Systems with High Penetration of Distributed Energy Resources,"Operational challenges introduced by integration of high penetration of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) are well known. These challenges range from technical constraint violations, such as: overloads on feeders, over- or under- voltages in network nodes, and reverse power flows, to inaccurate operational planning due to uncertain production of renewable resources. However, recent advances in specialized software packages for active management of DERs could turn these challenges into the operational and monetary benefits for both distribution utilities, as well as end customers. Hence, if managed and operated in an optimal way, DERs could be highly-valuable resources for increasing efficiency of the overall management of distribution grids, as well as for providing much-needed flexibility in the operation of today’s active systems. Utility Distribution Energy Resource Management Systems (Utility DERMS) aims to offer all these capabilities integrated in a single software package. This paper explores capabilities of state-of-the-art DERMS software for helping utilities to pave the way towards stable, optimal, and secure emerging distribution systems with high penetration of volatile DERs.",Distributed Systems,activ manag distribut system high penetr distribut energi resourc,oper challeng introduc integr high penetr renew distribut energi resourc der well known challeng rang technic constraint violat overload feeder voltag network node revers power flow inaccur oper plan due uncertain product renew resourc howev recent advanc special softwar packag activ manag der could turn challeng oper monetari benefit distribut util well end custom henc manag oper optim way der could highlyvalu resourc increas effici overal manag distribut grid well provid muchneed flexibl oper today activ system util distribut energi resourc manag system util derm aim offer capabl integr singl softwar packag paper explor capabl stateoftheart derm softwar help util pave way toward stabl optim secur emerg distribut system high penetr volatil der,activ manag distribut system high penetr distribut energi resourc oper challeng introduc integr high penetr renew distribut energi resourc der well known challeng rang technic constraint violat overload feeder voltag network node revers power flow inaccur oper plan due uncertain product renew resourc howev recent advanc special softwar packag activ manag der could turn challeng oper monetari benefit distribut util well end custom henc manag oper optim way der could highlyvalu resourc increas effici overal manag distribut grid well provid muchneed flexibl oper today activ system util distribut energi resourc manag system util derm aim offer capabl integr singl softwar packag paper explor capabl stateoftheart derm softwar help util pave way toward stabl optim secur emerg distribut system high penetr volatil der,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21932424098267575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0671055930952841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06461688612001847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07310808032755858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13692417441559174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15679255758409094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17083106447749083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3566332840669945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664569882557546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05986076004518827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06917247386346925,0.0,0.0,0.08695926844976387,0.21932424098267575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07066471338847098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08861745657374255,0.08012626236620243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08012626236620243,0.0,0.07066471338847098,0.21434967661073975,0.0,0.0,0.05226418586136365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05803318958169103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12370197349326743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664569882557546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32017838406982757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047407302394412744,0.0,0.0,0.08541553223874541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08012626236620243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27772241303212697,0.0,0.1258333572811934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03761882816562184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684596562114068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05938968369420279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06990615599256145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05159621684910014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684596562114068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06777356210754762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33228494127877306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06521359615422695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09040843618657073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15578312652298978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08861745657374255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14769985923722737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08012626236620243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07144989220357992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2608543846169078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08397146345397984,0.0,0.0,0.15170268817860716,0.2013167792858523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
